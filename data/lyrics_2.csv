Well, I suppose a friend is a friend And we all know how this will end Chimney swift that finds me, be my keeper  Silhouette of the cedar  What is that song you sing for the dead? What is that song you sing for the dead? I see the signal searchlight strike me in the window of my room Well, I got nothing to prove Well, I got nothing to prove I forgive you, mother, I can hear you  And I long to be near you  But every road leads to an end Yes, every road leads to an end Your apparition passes through me in the willows Five red hens – you’ll never see us again You’ll never see us again"
4tcwdkKzXn0Tsyz3WtH3gc,In my mind In a future five years from now I'm a hundred and twenty pounds And I never get hung over Because I will be the picture of discipline Never minding what state I'm in And I will be someone I admire And it's funny how I imagined That I would be that person now But it does not seem to have happened Maybe I've just forgotten how to see That I am not exactly the person that I thought I'd be And in my mind In the faraway here and now I've become in control somehow And I never lose my wallet Because I will be the picture of discipline Never fucking up anything And I'll be a good defensive driver And it's funny how I imagined That I would be that person now But it does not seem to have happened Maybe I've just forgotten how to see That I'll never be the person that I thought I'd be And in my mind When I'm old I am beautiful Planting tulips and vegetables Which I will mindfully watch over Not like me now I'm so busy with everything That I don't look at anything But I'm sure I'll look when I am older And it's funny how I imagined That I could be that person now But that's not what I want If that's what I wanted Then I'd be giving up somehow How strange to see That I don't wanna be the person that I want to be And in my mind I imagine so many things Things that aren't really happening And when they put me in the ground I'll start pounding the lid Saying I haven't finished yet I still have a tattoo to get That says I'm living in the moment And it's funny how I imagined That I could win this winless fight But maybe it isn't all that funny That I've been fighting all my life But maybe I have to think it's funny If I wanna live before I die And maybe it's funniest of all To think I'll die before I actually see That I am exactly the person that I want to be Fuck yes I am exactly the person that I want to be

It's starting to fly See how the hands go Waving goodbye And you know I get so forgetful When I look in your eyes Now she's walking backwards  Through a parade And I'm stuck in the shadow  Blocking the shade And there ain't no way to sweep up  The mess that we've made She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed Flowers for the sick and dead She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow She'll turn to stone at hospitals and funeral homes And when the fog rises Somebody sighs who is not in disguise anymore There's nothing to keep you  From falling in love It starts at the bottom  And comes from above Like pieces of a puzzle Like a hand in a glove She gets dressed up like a pillow so she's always in bed Flowers for the sick and dead She's on the go, way too fast and way too slow She'll turn and stop at hospitals and funeral homes And when the tide rises Somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye Somebody sinks and is gone in the blink of an eye"

7CFfGfrq3ACeUTs3Dp1UJ4,"In the year , the signals were given for the rest of the century: the blacks would be put back; the strikes of white workers would not be tolerated; the industrial and political elites of North and South would take hold of the country and organize the greatest march of economic growth in human history. They would do it with the aid of, and at the expense of, black labor, white labor, Chinese labor, European immigrant labor, female labor, rewarding them differently by race, sex, national origin, and social class, in such a way as to create separate levels of oppression-a skillful terracing to stabilize the pyramid of wealth. Between the Civil War and , steam and electricity replaced human muscle, iron replaced wood, and steel replaced iron . Machines could now drive steel tools. Oil could lubricate machines and light homes, streets, factories. People and goods could move by railroad, propelled by steam along steel rails; by  there were , miles of railroad. The telephone, the typewriter, and the adding machine speeded up the work of business. Machines changed farming. Before the Civil War it took  hours of labor to produce an acre of wheat. By , it took  hours,  minutes. Manufactured ice enabled the transport of food over long distances, and the industry of meatpacking was born. Steam drove textile mill spindles; it drove sewing machines. It came from coal. Pneumatic drills now drilled deeper into the earth for coal. In ,  million tons of coal were mined; by  it was  million tons. More coal meant more steel, because coal furnaces converted iron into steel; by  a million tons of steel were being produced; by ,  million tons. By now electricity was beginning to replace steam. Electrical wire needed copper, of which , tons were produced in ; , tons by . To accomplish all this required ingenious inventors of new processes and new machines, clever organizers and administrators of the new corporations, a country rich with land and minerals, and a huge supply of human beings to do the back-breaking, unhealthful, and dangerous work. Immigrants would come from Europe and China, to make the new labor force. Farmers unable to buy the new machinery or pay the new railroad rates would move to the cities. Between  and , New York grew from , to  million, Chicago from , to  million, Philadelphia from , to  / million. In some cases the inventor himself became the organizer of businesses-like Thomas Edison, inventor of electrical devices. In other cases, the businessman compiled other people's inventions, like Gustavus Swift, a Chicago butcher who put together the ice-cooled railway car with the ice- cooled warehouse to make the first national meatpacking company in . James Duke used a new cigarette-rolling machine that could roll, paste, and cut tubes of tobacco into , cigarettes a day; in  he combined the four biggest cigarette producers to form the American Tobacco Company. While some multimillionaires started in poverty, most did not. A study of the origins of  textile, railroad, and steel executives of the s showed that  percent came from middle- or upper-class families. The Horatio Alger stories of ""rags to riches"" were true for a few men, but mostly a myth, and a useful myth for control. Most of the fortune building was done legally, with the collaboration of the government and the courts. Sometimes the collaboration had to be paid for. Thomas Edison promised New Jersey politicians $, each in return for favorable legislation. Daniel Drew and Jay Gould spent $ million to bribe the New York legislature to legalize their issue of $ million in ""watered stock""  on the Erie Railroad. The first transcontinental railroad was built with blood, sweat, politics and thievery, out of the meeting of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads. The Central Pacific started on the West Coast going east; it spent $, in Washington on bribes to get  million acres of free land and $ million in bonds, and paid $ million, an overpayment of $ million, to a construction company which really was its own. The construction was done by three thousand Irish and ten thousand Chinese, over a period of four years, working for one or two dollars a day. The Union Pacific started in Nebraska going west. It had been given  million acres of free land and $ million in government bonds. It created the Credit Mobilier company and gave them $ million for construction when the actual cost was $ million. Shares were sold cheaply to Congressmen to prevent investigation. This was at the suggestion of Massachusetts Congressman Oakes Ames, a shovel manufacturer and director of Credit Mobilier, who said: ""There is no difficulty in getting men to look after their own property."" The Union Pacific used twenty thousand workers-war veterans and Irish immigrants, who laid  miles of track a day and died by the hundreds in the heat, the cold, and the battles with Indians opposing the invasion of their territory. Both railroads used longer, twisting routes to get subsidies from towns they went through. In , amid music and speeches, the two crooked lines met in Utah. The wild fraud on the railroads led to more control of railroad finances by bankers, who wanted more stability-profit by law rather than by theft. By the s, most of the country's railway mileage was concentrated in six huge systems. Four of these were completely or partially controlled by the House of Morgan, and two others by the bankers Kuhn, Loeb, and Company. J. P. Morgan had started before the war, as the son of a banker who began selling stocks for the railroads for good commissions. During the Civil War he bought five thousand rifles for $. each from an army arsenal, and sold them to a general in the field for $ each. The rifles were defective and would shoot off the thumbs of the soldiers using them. A congressional committee noted this in the small print of an obscure report, but a federal judge upheld the deal as the fulfillment of a valid legal contract. Morgan had escaped military service in the Civil War by paying $ to a substitute. So did John D. Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, Philip Armour, Jay Gould, and James Mellon. Mellon's father had written to him that ""a man may be a patriot without risking his own life or sacrificing his health. There are plenty of lives less valuable."" It was the firm of Drexel, Morgan and Company that was given a U.S. government contract to float a bond issue of $ million. The government could have sold the bonds directly; it chose to pay the bankers $ million in commission. On January , , as Gustavus Myers reports: ... a circular marked ""Private and Confidential"" was issued by the three banking houses of Drexel, Morgan & Company, Brown Brothers & Company, and Kidder, Peabody & Company. The most painstaking care was exercised that this document should not find its way into the press or otherwise become public.... Why this fear? Because the circular was an invitation ... to the great railroad magnates to assemble at Morgan's house, No.  Madison Avenue, there to form, in the phrase of the day, an iron-clad combination. ... a compact which would efface competition among certain railroads, and unite those interests in an agreement by which the people of the United States would be bled even more effectively than before. There was a human cost to this exciting story of financial ingenuity. That year, , records of the Interstate Commerce Commission showed that , railroad workers were killed or injured. In  the gold reserve of the United States was depleted, while twenty-six New York City banks had $ million in gold in their vaults. A syndicate of bankers headed by J. P. Morgan & Company, August Belmont & Company, the National City Bank, and others offered to give the government gold in exchange for bonds. President Grover Cleveland agreed. The bankers immediately resold the bonds at higher prices, making $ million profit. A journalist wrote: ""If a man wants to buy beef, he must go to the butcher.... If Mr. Cleveland wants much gold, he must go to the big banker."" While making his fortune, Morgan brought rationality and organization to the national economy. He kept the system stable. He said: ""We do not want financial convulsions and have one thing one day and another thing another day."" He linked railroads to one another, all of them to banks, banks to insurance companies. By , he controlled , miles of railroad, half the country's mileage. Three insurance companies dominated by the Morgan group had a billion dollars in assets. They had $ million a year to invest-money given by ordinary people for their insurance policies. Louis Brandeis, describing this in his book Other People's Money , wrote: ""They control the people through the people's own money."" John D. Rockefeller started as a bookkeeper in Cleveland, became a merchant, accumulated money, and decided that, in the new industry of oil, who controlled the oil refineries controlled the industry. He bought his first oil refinery in , and by  set up Standard Oil Company of Ohio, made secret agreements with railroads to ship his oil with them if they gave him rebates- discounts-on their prices, and thus drove competitors out of business. One independent refiner said: ""If we did not sell out.... we would be crushed out.. .. There was only one buyer on the market and we had to sell at their terms."" Memos like this one passed among Standard Oil officials: ""Wilkerson & Co. received car of oil Monday th... . Please turn another screw."" A rival refinery in Buffalo was rocked by a small explosion arranged by Standard Oil officials with the refinery's chief mechanic. The Standard Oil Company, by , was a holding company which controlled the stock of many other companies. The capital was $ million, the profit was $ million a year, and John D. Rockefeller's fortune was estimated at $ million. Before long he would move into iron, copper, coal, shipping, and banking . Profits would be $ million a year, and the Rockefeller fortune would total two billion dollars. Andrew Carnegie was a telegraph clerk at seventeen, then secretary to the head of the Pennsylvania Railroad, then broker in Wall Street selling railroad bonds for huge commissions, and was soon a millionaire. He went to London in , saw the new Bessemer method of producing steel, and returned to the United States to build a million-dollar steel plant. Foreign competition was kept out by a high tariff conveniently set by Congress, and by  Carnegie was producing , tons of steel a month, making $ / million a year in profit. By  he was making $ million a year, and that year, at a dinner party, he agreed to sell his steel company to J. P. Morgan. He scribbled the price on a note: $,,. Morgan then formed the U.S. Steel Corporation, combining Carnegie's corporation with others. He sold stocks and bonds for $,,,  and took a fee of  million for arranging the consolidation. How could dividends be paid to all those stockholders and bondholders? By making sure Congress passed tariffs keeping out foreign steel; by closing off competition and maintaining the price at $ a ton; and by working , men twelve hours a day for wages that barely kept their families alive. And so it went, in industry after industry-shrewd, efficient businessmen building empires, choking out competition, maintaining high prices, keeping wages low, using government subsidies. These industries were the first beneficiaries of the ""welfare state."" By the turn of the century, American Telephone and telegraph had a monopoly of the nation's telephone system, International Harvester made  percent of all farm machinery, and in every other industry resources became concentrated, controlled. The banks had interests in so many of these monopolies as to create an interlocking network of powerful corporation directors, each of whom sat on the boards of many other corporations. According to a Senate report of the early twentieth century, Morgan at his peak sat on the board of forty-eight corporations; Rockefeller, thirty-seven corporations. Meanwhile, the government of the United States was behaving almost exactly as Karl Marx described a capitalist state: pretending neutrality to maintain order, but serving the interests of the rich. Not that the rich agreed among themselves; they had disputes over policies. But the purpose of the state was to settle upper-class disputes peacefully, control lower-class rebellion, and adopt policies that would further the long-range stability of the system. The arrangement between Democrats and Republicans to elect Rutherford Hayes in  set the tone. Whether Democrats or Republicans won, national policy would not change in any important way. When Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, ran for President in , the general impression in the country was that he opposed the power of monopolies and corporations, and that the Republican party, whose candidate was James Blaine, stood for the wealthy. But when Cleveland defeated Blaine, Jay Gould wired him: ""I feel ... that the vast business interests of the country will be entirely safe in your hands."" And he was right. One of Cleveland's chief advisers was William Whitney, a millionaire and corporation lawyer, who married into the Standard Oil fortune and was appointed Secretary of the Navy by Cleveland. He immediately set about to create a ""steel navy,"" buying the steel at artificially high prices from Carnegie's plants. Cleveland himself assured industrialists that his election should not frighten them: ""No harm shall come to any business interest as the result of administrative policy so long as I am President ... a transfer of executive control from one party to another does not mean any serious disturbance of existing conditions."" The presidential election itself had avoided real issues; there was no clear understanding of which interests would gain and which would lose if certain policies were adopted. It took the usual form of election campaigns, concealing the basic similarity of the parties by dwelling on personalities, gossip, trivialities. Henry Adams, an astute literary commentator on that era, wrote to a friend about the election: We are here plunged in politics funnier than words can express. Very great issues are involved.. . . But the amusing thing is that no one talks about real interests. By common consent they agree to let these alone. We are afraid to discuss them. Instead of this the press is engaged in a most amusing dispute whether Mr. Cleveland had an illegitimate child and did or did not live with more than one mistress. In , with a huge surplus in the treasury, Cleveland vetoed a bill appropriating $, to give relief to Texas farmers to help them buy seed grain during a drought. He said: ""Federal aid in such cases .. . encourages the expectation of paternal care on the part of the government and weakens the sturdiness of our national character."" But that same year, Cleveland used his gold surplus to pay off wealthy bondholders at $ above the $ value of each bond-a gift of $ million. The chief reform of the Cleveland administration gives away the secret of reform legislation in America. The Interstate Commerce Act of  was supposed to regulate the railroads on behalf of the consumers. But Richard Olney, a lawyer for the Boston & Maine and other railroads, and soon to be Cleveland's Attorney General, told railroad officials who complained about the Interstate Commerce Commission that it would not be wise to abolish the Commission ""from a railroad point of view."" He explained: The Commission ... is or can be made, of great use to the railroads. It satisfies the popular clamor for a government supervision of railroads, at the same time that that supervision is almost entirely nominal. . . . The part of wisdom is not to destroy the Commission, but to utilize it. Cleveland himself, in his  State of the Union message, had made a similar point, adding a warning: ""Opportunity for safe, careful, and deliberate reform is now offered; and none of us should be unmindful of a time when an abused and irritated people . . . may insist upon a radical and sweeping rectification of their wrongs."" Republican Benjamin Harrison, who succeeded Cleveland as President from  to , was described by Matthew Josephson, in his colorful study of the post-Civil War years, The Politicos: ""Benjamin Harrison had the exclusive distinction of having served the railway corporations in the dual capacity of lawyer and soldier. He prosecuted the strikers  in the federal courts . .. and he also organized and commanded a company of soldiers during the strike. ..."" Harrison's term also saw a gesture toward reform. The Sherman Anti-Trust Act, passed in , called itself ""An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints"" and made it illegal to form a ""combination or conspiracy"" to restrain trade in interstate or foreign commerce. Senator John Sherman, author of the Act, explained the need to conciliate the critics of monopoly: ""They had monopolies ... of old, but never before such giants as in our day. You must heed their appeal or be ready for the socialist, the communist, the nihilist. Society is now disturbed by forces never felt before. . . ."" When Cleveland was elected President again in , Andrew Carnegie, in Europe, received a letter from the manager of his steel plants, Henry Clay Frick: ""I am very sorry for President Harrison, but I cannot see that our interests are going to be affected one way or the other by the change in administration."" Cleveland, facing the agitation in the country caused by the panic and depression of , used troops to break up ""Coxey's Army,"" a demonstration of unemployed men who had come to Washington, and again to break up the national strike on the railroads the following year. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court, despite its look of somber, black-robed fairness, was doing its bit for the ruling elite. How could it be independent, with its members chosen by the President and ratified by the Senate? How could it be neutral between rich and poor when its members were often former wealthy lawyers, and almost always came from the upper class? Early in the nineteenth century the Court laid the legal basis for a nationally regulated economy by establishing federal control over interstate commerce, and the legal basis for corporate capitalism by making the contract sacred. In  the Court interpreted the Sherman Act so as to make it harmless. It said a monopoly of sugar refining was a monopoly in manufacturing, not commerce, and so could not be regulated by Congress through the Sherman Act . The Court also said the Sherman Act could be used against interstate strikes  because they were in restraint of trade. It also declared unconstitutional a small attempt by Congress to tax high incomes at a higher rate . In later years it would refuse to break up the Standard Oil and American Tobacco monopolies, saying the Sherman Act barred only ""unreasonable"" combinations in restraint of trade. A New York banker toasted the Supreme Court in : ""I give you, gentlemen, the Supreme Court of the United States-guardian of the dollar, defender of private property, enemy of spoliation, sheet anchor of the Republic."" Very soon after the Fourteenth Amendment became law, the Supreme Court began to demolish it as a protection for blacks, and to develop it as a protection for corporations. However, in , a Supreme Court decision  approved state laws regulating the prices charged to farmers for the use of grain elevators. The grain elevator company argued it was a person being deprived of property, thus violating the Fourteenth Amendment's declaration ""nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law."" The Supreme Court disagreed, saying that grain elevators were not simply private property but were invested with ""a public interest"" and so could be regulated. One year after that decision, the American Bar Association, organized by lawyers accustomed to serving the wealthy, began a national campaign of education to reverse the Court decision. Its presidents said, at different times: ""If trusts are a defensive weapon of property interests against the communistic trend, they are desirable."" And: ""Monopoly is often a necessity and an advantage."" By , they succeeded. State legislatures, under the pressure of aroused farmers, had passed laws to regulate the rates charged farmers by the railroads. The Supreme Court that year  said states could not do this, that this was an intrusion on federal power. That year alone, the Court did away with  state laws that had been passed to regulate corporations. By this time the Supreme Court had accepted the argument that corporations were ""persons"" and their money was property protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Supposedly, the Amendment had been passed to protect Negro rights, but of the Fourteenth Amendment cases brought before the Supreme Court between  and , nineteen dealt with the Negro,  dealt with corporations. The justices of the Supreme Court were not simply interpreters of the Constitution. They were men of certain backgrounds, of certain interests. One of them  had said in : ""It is vain to contend with Judges who have been at the bar the advocates for forty years of railroad companies, and all forms of associated capital. . . ."" In , Supreme Court Justice David J. Brewer, addressing the New York State Bar Association, said: It is the unvarying law that the wealth of the community will be in the hands of the few. . . . The great majority of men are unwilling to endure that long self-denial and saving which makes accumulations possible . .. and hence it always has been, and until human nature is remodeled always will be true, that the wealth of a nation is in the hands of a few, while the many subsist upon the proceeds of their daily toil. This was not just a whim of the s and s-it went back to the Founding Fathers, who had learned their law in the era of Blackstone's Commentaries, which said: ""So great is the regard of the law for private property, that it will not authorize the least violation of it; no, not even for the common good of the whole community."" Control in modern times requires more than force, more than law. It requires that a population dangerously concentrated in cities and factories, whose lives are filled with cause for rebellion, be taught that all is right as it is. And so, the schools, the churches, the popular literature taught that to be rich was a sign of superiority, to be poor a sign of personal failure, and that the only way upward for a poor person was to climb into the ranks of the rich by extraordinary effort and extraordinary luck. In those years after the Civil War, a man named Russell Conwell, a graduate of Yale Law School, a minister, and author of best-selling books, gave the same lecture, ""Acres of Diamonds,"" more than five thousand times to audiences across the country, reaching several million people in all. His message was that anyone could get rich if he tried hard enough, that everywhere, if people looked closely enough, were ""acres of diamonds."" A sampling: I say that you ought to get rich, and it is your duty to get rich.... The men who get rich may be the most honest men you find in the community. Let me say here clearly .. . ninety-eight out of one hundred of the rich men of America are honest. That is why they are rich. That is why they are trusted with money. That is why they carry on great enterprises and find plenty of people to work with them. It is because they are honest men. ... ... I sympathize with the poor, but the number of poor who are to be sympathised with is very small. To sympathize with a man whom God has punished for his sins ... is to do wrong.... let us remember there is not a poor person in the United States who was not made poor by his own shortcomings. ... Conwell was a founder of Temple University. Rockefeller was a donor to colleges all over the country and helped found the University of Chicago. Huntington, of the Central Pacific, gave money to two Negro colleges, Hampton Institute and Tuskegee Institute. Carnegie gave money to colleges and to libraries. Johns Hopkins was founded by a millionaire merchant, and millionaires Cornelius Vanderbilt, Ezra Cornell, James Duke, and Leland Stanford created universities in their own names. The rich, giving part of their enormous earnings in this way, became known as philanthropists. These educational institutions did not encourage dissent; they trained the middlemen in the American system-the teachers, doctors, lawyers, administrators, engineers, technicians, politicians- those who would be paid to keep the system going, to be loyal buffers against trouble. In the meantime, the spread of public school education enabled the learning of writing, reading, and arithmetic for a whole generation of workers, skilled and semiskilled, who would be the literate or force of the new industrial age. It was important that these people learn obedience to authority. A journalist observer of the schools in the s wrote: ""The unkindly spirit of the teacher is strikingly apparent; the pupils, being completely subjugated to her will, are silent and motionless, the spiritual atmosphere of the classroom is damp and chilly."" Back in , the desire of mill owners in the town of Lowell that their workers be educated was explained by the secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education: The owners of factories are more concerned than other classes and interests in the intelligence of their laborers. When the latter are well-educated and the former are disposed to deal justly, controversies and strikes can never occur, nor can the minds of the masses be prejudiced by demagogues and controlled by temporary and factious considerations. Joel Spring, in his book Education and the Rise of the Corporate State, says: ""The development of a factory-like system in the nineteenth-century schoolroom was not accidental."" This continued into the twentieth century, when William Bagley's Classroom Management became a standard teacher training text, reprinted thirty times. Bagley said: ""One who studies educational theory aright can see in the mechanical routine of the classroom the educative forces that are slowly transforming the child from a little savage into a creature of law and order, fit for the life of civilized society."" It was in the middle and late nineteenth century that high schools developed as aids to the industrial system, that history was widely required in the curriculum to foster patriotism. Loyalty oaths, teacher certification, and the requirement of citizenship were introduced to control both the educational and the political quality of teachers. Also, in the latter part of the century, school officials-not teachers-were given control over textbooks. Laws passed by the states barred certain kinds of textbooks. Idaho and Montana, for instance, forbade textbooks propagating ""political"" doctrines, and the Dakota territory ruled that school libraries could not have ""partisan political pamphlets or books."" Against this gigantic organization of knowledge and education for orthodoxy and obedience, there arose a literature of dissent and protest, which had to make its way from reader to reader against great obstacles. Henry George, a self-educated workingman from a poor Philadelphia family, who became a newspaperman and an economist, wrote a book that was published in  and sold millions of copies, not only in the United States, but all over the world. His book Progress and Poverty argued that the basis of wealth was land, that this was becoming monopolized, and that a single tax on land, abolishing all others, would bring enough revenue to solve the problem of poverty and equalize wealth in the nation. Readers may not have been persuaded of his solutions, but they could see in their own lives the accuracy of his observations: It is true that wealth has been greatly increased, and that the average of comfort, leisure and refinement has been raised; but these gains are not general. In them the lowest class do not share... This association of poverty with progress is the great enigma of our times. ... There is a vague but general feeling of disappointment; an increased bitterness among the working classes; a widespread feeling of unrest and brooding revolution.. . . The civilized world is trembling on the verge of a great movement. Either it must be a leap upward, which will open the way to advances yet undreamed of, or it must he a plunge downward which will carry us back toward barbarism. ... A different kind of challenge to the economic and social system was given by Edward Bellamy, a lawyer and writer from western Massachusetts, who wrote, in simple, intriguing language, a novel called Looking Backward, in which the author fells asleep and wakes up in the year , to find a socialistic society in which people work and live cooperatively. Looking Backward, which described socialism vividly, lovingly, sold a million copies in a few years, and over a hundred groups were organized around the country to try to make the dream come true. It seemed that despite the strenuous efforts of government, business, the church, the schools, to control their thinking, millions of Americans were ready to consider harsh criticism of the existing system, to contemplate other possible ways of living. They were helped in this by the great movements of workers and farmers that swept the country in the s and s. These movements went beyond the scattered strikes and tenants' struggles of the period -. They were nationwide movements, more threatening than before to the ruling elite, more dangerously suggestive. It was a time when revolutionary organizations existed in major American cities, and revolutionary talk was in the air. In the s and s, immigrants were pouring in from Europe at a faster rate than before. They all went through the harrowing ocean voyage of the poor. Now there were not so many Irish and German immigrants as Italians, Russians, Jews, Greeks-people from Southern and Eastern Europe, even more alien to native-born Anglo-Saxons than the earlier newcomers. How the immigration of different ethnic groups contributed to the fragmentation of the working class, how conflicts developed among groups facing the same difficult conditions, is shown in an article in a Bohemian newspaper, Svornost, of February , . A petition of  parents and guardians at the Throop School in New York, signed by over half the taxpayers of the school district, said ""the petitioners have just as much right to request the teaching of Bohemian as have the German citizens to have German taught in the public schools.... In opposition to this, Mr. Vocke claims that there is a great deal of difference between Germans and Bohemians, or in other words, they are superior."" The Irish, still recalling the hatred against them when they arrived, began to get jobs with the new political machines that wanted their vote. Those who became policemen encountered the new Jewish immigrants. On July , , New York's Jewish community held a mass funeral for an important rabbi, and a riot took place, led by Irish who resented Jews coming into their neighborhood. The police force was dominantly Irish, and the official investigation of the riot indicated the police helped the rioters: "". .. it appears that charges of unprovoked and most brutal clubbing have been made against policemen, with the result that they were reprimanded or fined a day's pay and were yet retained upon the force."" There was desperate economic competition among the newcomers. By , Chinese immigrants, brought in by the railroads to do the backbreaking labor at pitiful wages, numbered , in California, almost one-tenth of the population. They became the objects of continuous violence. The novelist Bret Harte wrote an obituary for a Chinese man named Wan Lee: Dead, my revered friends, dead. Stoned to death in the streets of San Francisco, in the year of grace  by a mob of halfgrown boys and Christian school children. In Rock Springs, Wyoming, in the summer of , whites attacked five hundred Chinese miners, massacring twenty-eight of them in cold blood. The new immigrants became laborers, housepainters, stonecutters, ditchdiggers. They were often imported en masse by contractors. One Italian man, told he was going to Connecticut to work on the railroad, was taken instead to sulfate mines in the South, where he and his fellows were watched over by armed guards in their barracks and in the mines, given only enough money to pay for their railroad fare and tools, and very little to eat. He and others decided to escape. They were captured at gunpoint, ordered to work or die; they still refused and were brought before a judge, put in manacles, and, five months after their arrival, finally dismissed. ""My comrades took the train for New York. I had only one dollar, and with this, not knowing either the country or the language, I had to walk to New York. After forty-two days I arrived in the city utterly exhausted."" Their conditions led sometimes to rebellion. A contemporary observer told how ""some Italians who worked in a locality near Deal Lake, New Jersey, failing to receive their wages, captured the contractor and shut him up in the shanty, where he remained a prisoner until the county sheriff came with a posse to his rescue."" A traffic in immigrant child laborers developed, either by contract with desperate parents in the home country or by kidnapping. The children were then supervised by ""padrones"" in a form of slavery, sometimes sent out as beggar musicians. Droves of them roamed the streets of New York and Philadelphia. As the immigrants became naturalized citizens, they were brought into the American two-party system, invited to be loyal to one party or the other, their political energy thus siphoned into elections. An article in L'ltalia, in November , called for Italians to support the Republican party: When American citizens of foreign birth refuse to ally themselves with the Republican Party, they make war upon their own welfare. The Republican Party stands for all that the people fight for in the Old World. It is the champion of freedom, progress, order, and law. It is the steadfast foe of monarchial class role. There were  / million immigrants in the s,  million in the s, creating a labor surplus that kept wages down. The immigrants were more controllable, more helpless than native workers; they were culturally displaced, at odds with one another, therefore useful as strikebreakers. Often their children worked, intensifying the problem of an oversized labor force and joblessness; in  there were ,, children under sixteen  at work in the United States. With everyone working long hours, families often became strangers to one another. A pants presser named Morris Rosenfeld wrote a poem, ""My Boy,"" which became widely reprinted and recited: I have a little boy at home, A pretty little son; I think sometimes the world is mine In him, my only one. . . . 'Ere dawn my labor drives me forth; Tis night when I am free; A stranger am I to my child; And stranger my child to me. ... Women immigrants became servants, prostitutes, housewives, factory workers, and sometimes rebels. Leonora Barry was born in Ireland and brought to the United States. She got married, and when her husband died she went to work in a hosiery mill in upstate New York to support three young children, earning  cents her first week. She joined the Knights of Labor, which had fifty thousand women members in  women's assemblies by . She became ""master workman"" of her assembly of  women, and was appointed to work for the Knights as a general investigator, to ""go forth and educate her sister working-women and the public generally as to their needs and necessities."" She described the biggest problem of women workers: ""Through long years of endurance they have acquired, as a sort of second nature, the habit of submission and acceptance without question of any terms offered them, with the pessimistic view of life in which they see no hope."" Her report for the year  showed:  requests to help women organize,  cities and towns visited, , leaflets distributed. In , women's assemblies of textile workers and hatmakers went on strike. The following year in New York, cloak and shirt makers, men and women , went on strike. The New York World called it ""a revolt for bread and butter."" They won higher wages and shorter hours. That winter in Yonkers, a few women carpet weavers were fired for joining the Knights, and in the cold of February, , women walked out and picketed the mill. Only seven hundred of them were members of the Knights, but all the strikers soon joined. The police attacked the picket line and arrested them, but a jury found them not guilty. A great dinner was held by working people in New York to honor them, with two thousand delegates from unions all over the city. The strike lasted six months, and the women won some of their demands, getting back their jobs, but without recognition of their union. What was astonishing in so many of these struggles was not that the strikers did not win all that they wanted, but that, against such great odds, they dared to resist, and were not destroyed. Perhaps it was the recognition that day-to-day combat was not enough, that fundamental change was needed, which stimulated the growth of revolutionary movements at this time. The Socialist Labor party, formed in , was tiny, and torn by internal arguments, but it had some influence in organizing unions among foreign workers. In New York, Jewish socialists organized and put out a newspaper. In Chicago, German revolutionaries, along with native-born radicals like Albert Parsons, formed Social Revolutionary clubs. In , an anarchist congress took place in Pittsburgh. It drew up a manifesto: ... All laws are directed against the working people. . .. Even the school serves only the purpose of furnishing the offspring of the wealthy with those qualities necessary to uphold their class domination. The children of the poor get scarcely a formal elementary training, and this, too, is mainly directed to such branches as tend to producing prejudices, arrogance, and servility; in short, want of sense. The Church finally seeks to make complete idiots out of the mass and to make them forego the paradise on earth by promising a fictitious heaven. The capitalist press, on the other hand, takes care of the confusion of spirits in public life. . .. The workers can therefore expect no help from any capitalistic party in their struggle against the existing system. They must achieve their liberation by their own efforts. As in former times, a privileged class never surrenders its tyranny, neither can it be expected that the capitalists of this age will give up their rulership without being forced to do it. ... The manifesto asked ""equal rights for all without distinction to sex or race."" It quoted the Communist Manifesto: ""Workmen of all lands, unite! You have nothing to lose but your chains; you have a world to win!"" In Chicago, the new International Working People's Association had five thousand members, published newspapers in five languages, organized mass demonstrations and parades, and through its leadership in strikes was a powerful influence in the twenty-two unions that made up the Central Labor Union of Chicago. There were differences in theory among all these revolutionary groups, but the theorists were often brought together by the practical needs of labor struggles, and there were many in the mid-s. In early , the Texas & Pacific Railroad fired a leader of the district assembly of the Knights of Labor, and this led to a strike which spread throughout the Southwest, tying up traffic as far as St. Louis and Kansas City. Nine young men recruited in New Orleans as marshals, brought to Texas to protect company property, learned about the strike and quit their jobs, saying, ""as man to man we could not justifiably go to work and take the bread out of our fellow-workmen's mouths, no matter how much we needed it ourselves."" They were then arrested for defrauding the company by refusing to work, and sentenced to three months in the Galveston county jail. The strikers engaged in sabotage. A news dispatch from Atchison, Kansas: At : this morning the men on guard at the Missouri Pacific roundhouse were surprised by the appearance of  or  masked men. The guards were corralled in the oil room by a detachment of the visitors who stood guard with pistols .. . while the rest of them thoroughly disabled  locomotives which stood in the stalls. In April, in East St. Louis, there was a battle between strikers and police. Seven workingmen were killed, whereupon workers burned the freight depot of the Louisville & Nashville. The governor declared martial law and sent in seven hundred National Guardsmen. With mass arrests, violent attacks by sheriffs and deputies, no support from the skilled, paid-paid workers of the Railway Brotherhoods, the strikers could not hold out. After several months they surrendered, and many of them were blacklisted. By the spring of , the movement for an eight-hour day had grown. On May , the American Federation of Labor, now five years old, called for nationwide strikes wherever the eight-hour day was refused. Terence Powderly, head of the Knights of Labor, opposed the strike, saying that employers and employees must first be educated on the eight-hour day, but assemblies of the Knights made plans to strike. The grand chief of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers opposed the eight-hour day, saying ""two hours less work means two hours more loafing about the corners and two hours more for drink,"" but railroad workers did not agree and supported the eight- hour movement. So, , workers in , establishments all over the country went out on strike. In Detroit, , workers marched in an eight-hour parade. In New York, , formed a torchlight procession along Broadway, headed by , members of the Bakers' Union. In Chicago, , struck, and , were granted a shorter working day to prevent them from striking. Every railroad in Chicago stopped running, and most of the industries in Chicago were paralyzed. The stockyards were closed down. A ""Citizens' Committee"" of businessmen met daily to map strategy in Chicago. The state militia had been called out, the police were ready, and the Chicago Mail on May  asked that Albert Parsons and August Spies, the anarchist leaders of the International Working People's Association, be watched. ""Keep them in view. Hold them personally responsible for any trouble that occurs. Make an example of them if trouble occurs."" Under the leadership of Parsons and Spies, the Central Labor Union, with twenty-two unions, had adopted a fiery resolution in the fall of : Be it Resolved, That we urgently call upon the wage-earning class to arm itself in order to be able to put forth against their exploiters such an argument which alone can be effective: Violence, and further be it Resolved, that notwithstanding that we expect very little from the introduction of the eight-hour day, we firmly promise to assist our more backward brethren in this class struggle with all means and power at our disposal, so long as they will continue to show an open and resolute front to our common oppressors, the aristocratic vagabonds and exploiters. Our war-cry is ""Death to the foes of the human race."" On May , a series of events took place which were to put Parsons and Spies in exactly the position that the Chicago Mail had suggested . That day, in front of the McCormick Harvester Works, where strikers and sympathizers fought scabs, the police fired into a crowd of strikers running from the scene, wounded many of them, and killed four. Spies, enraged, went to the printing shop of the Arbeiter-Zeitung and printed a circular in both English and German: Revenge! Workingmen, to Arms!!! . . . You have for years endured the most abject humiliations; . . . you have worked yourself to death... your Children you have sacrificed to the factory lord-in short: you have been miserable and obedient slaves all these years: Why? To satisfy the insatiable greed, to fill the coffers of your thieving master? When you ask them now to lessen your burdens, he sends his bloodhounds out to shoot you, kill you! ... To arms we call you, to arms! A meeting was called for Haymarket Square on the evening of May , and about three thousand persons assembled. It was a quiet meeting, and as storm clouds gathered and the hour grew late, the crowd dwindled to a few hundred. A detachment of  policemen showed up, advanced on the speakers' platform, ordered the crowd to disperse. The speaker said the meeting was almost over. A bomb then exploded in the midst of the police, wounding sixty-six policemen, of whom seven later died. The police fired into the crowd, killing several people, wounding two hundred. With no evidence on who threw the bomb, the police arrested eight anarchist leaders in Chicago. The Chicago Journal said: ""Justice should be prompt in dealing with the arrested anarchists. The law regarding accessories to crime in this State is so plain that their trials will be short."" Illinois law said that anyone inciting a murder was guilty of that murder. The evidence against the eight anarchists was their ideas, their literature; none had been at Haymarket that day except Fielden, who was speaking when the bomb exploded. A jury found them guilty, and they were sentenced to death. Their appeals were denied; the Supreme Court said it had no jurisdiction. The event aroused international excitement. Meetings took place in France, Holland, Russia, Italy, Spain. In London a meeting of protest was sponsored by George Bernard Shaw, William Morris, and Peter Kropotkin, among others. Shaw had responded in his characteristic way to the turning down of an appeal by the eight members of the Illinois Supreme Court: ""If the world must lose eight of its people, it can better afford to lose the eight members of the Illinois Supreme Court."" A year after the trial, four of the convicted anarchists-Albert Parsons, a printer, August Spies, an upholsterer, Adolph Eischer, and George Engel-were hanged. Louis Lingg, a twenty-one-year-old carpenter, blew himself up in his cell by exploding a dynamite tube in his mouth. Three remained in prison. The executions aroused people all over the country. There was a funeral march of , in Chicago. Some evidence came out that a man named Rudolph Schnaubelt, supposedly an anarchist, was actually an agent of the police, an agent provocateur, hired to throw the bomb and thus enable the arrest of hundreds, the destruction of the revolutionary leadership in Chicago. But to this day it has not been discovered who threw the bomb. While the immediate result was a suppression of the radical movement, the long-term effect was to keep alive the class anger of many, to inspire others-especially young people of that generation-to action in revolutionary causes. Sixty thousand signed petitions to the new governor of Illinois, John Peter Altgeld, who investigated the facts, denounced what had happened, and pardoned the three remaining prisoners. Year after year, all over the country, memorial meetings for the Haymarket martyrs were held; it is impossible to know the number of individuals whose political awakening-as with Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman, long-time revolutionary stalwarts of the next generation-came from the Haymarket Affair. After Haymarket, class conflict and violence continued, with strikes, lockouts, blacklisting, the use of Pinkerton detectives and police to break strikes with force, and courts to break them by law. During a strike of streetcar conductors on the Third Avenue Line in New York a month after the Haymarket Affair, police charged a crowd of thousands, using their clubs indiscriminately: ""The New York Sun reported: ""Men with broken scalps were crawling off in all directions...."" Some of the energy of resentment in late  was poured into the electoral campaign for mayor of New York that fall. Trade unions formed an Independent Labor party and nominated for mayor Henry George, the radical economist, whose Progress and Poverty had been read by tens of thousands of workers. George's platform tells something about the conditions of life for workers in New York in the s. It demanded: That property qualifications be abolished for members of juries. That Grand Jurors be chosen from the lower-class as well as from the upperclass, which dominated Grand Juries. That the police not interfere with peaceful meetings. That the sanitary inspection of buildings be enforced. That contract labor be abolished in public works. That there be equal pay for equal work for women. That the streetcars be owned by the municipal government. The Democrats nominated an iron manufacturer, Abram Hewitt, and the Republicans nominated Theodore Roosevelt, at a convention presided over by Elihu Root, a corporation lawyer, with the nominating speech given by Chauncey Depew, a railroad director. In a campaign of coercion and bribery, Hewitt was elected with  percent of the vote, George came second with  percent of the vote, and Roosevelt third with   percent of the vote. The New York World saw this as a signal: The deep-voiced protest conveyed in the , votes for Henry George against the combined power of both political parties, of Wall Street and the business interests, and of the public press should be a warning to the community to heed the demands of Labor so far as they are just and reasonable. . .. In other cities in the country too, labor candidates ran, polling , out of , votes in Chicago, electing a mayor in Milwaukee, and various local officials in Fort Worth, Texas, Eaton, Ohio, and Leadville, Colorado. It seemed that the weight of Haymarket had not crushed the labor movement. The year  became known to contemporaries as ""the year of the great uprising of labor."" From  to , strikes had averaged about  each year, involving perhaps , workers each year. In  there were over , strikes, involving , workers. John Commons, in his History of the Labor Movement in the United States, saw in that: ... the signs of a great movement by the class of the unskilled, which had finally risen in rebellion.. . . The movement bore in every way the aspect of a social war. A frenzied hatred of labour for capital was shown in every important strike.. .. Extreme bitterness toward capital manifested itself in all the actions of the Knights of Labor, and wherever the leaders undertook to hold it within bounds, they were generally discarded by their followers. . .. Even among southern blacks, where all the military, political, and economic force of the southern states, with the acquiescence of the national government, was concentrated on keeping them docile and working, there were sporadic rebellions. In the cotton fields, blacks were dispersed in their work, but in the sugar fields, work was done in gangs, so there was opportunity for organized action. In , they had struck to get a dollar a day instead of  cents, threatening to leave the state. Strikers were arrested and jailed, but they walked the roads along the sugar fields, carrying banners: ""A DOLLAR A DAY OR KANSAS."" They were arrested again and again for trespassing, and the strike was broken. By , however, the Knights of Labor was organizing in the sugar fields, in the peak year of the Knights' influence. The black workers, unable to feed and clothe their families on their wages, often paid in store scrip, asked a dollar a day once more. The following year, in the fall, close to ten thousand sugar laborers went on strike,  percent of them Negroes and members of the Knights. The militia arrived and gun battles began. Violence erupted in the town of Thibodaux, which had become a kind of refugee village where hundreds of strikers, evicted from their plantation shacks, gathered, penniless and ragged, carrying their bed clothing and babies. Their refusal to work threatened the entire sugar crop, and martial law was declared in Thibodaux. Henry and George Cox, two Negro brothers, leaders in the Knights of Labor, were arrested, locked up, then taken from their cells, and never heard from again. On the night of November , shooting broke out, each side claiming the other was at fault; by noon the next day, thirty Negroes were dead or dying, and hundreds wounded. Two whites were wounded. A Negro newspaper in New Orleans wrote: . . . Lame men and blind women shot; children and hoary-headed grandsires ruthlessly swept down! The Negroes offered no resistance; they could not, as the killing was unexpected. Those of them not killed took to the woods, a majority of them finding refuge in this city.. . . Citizens of the United States killed by a mob directed by a State judge. .. . Laboring men seeking an advance in wages, treated as if they were dogs! . .. At such times and upon such occasions, words of condemnation fall like snow-flakes upon molten lead. The blacks should defend their lives, and if needs must die, die with their faces toward their persecutors fighting for their homes, their children and their lawful rights. Native-born poor whites were not doing well either. In the South, they were tenant farmers rather than landowners. In the southern cities, they were tenants, not homeowners. C. Vann Woodward notes  that the city with the highest rate of tenancy in the United States was Birmingham, with  percent. And the slums of the southern cities were among the worst, poor whites living like the blacks, on unpaved dirt streets ""choked up with garbage, filth and mud,"" according to a report of one state board of health. There were eruptions against the convict labor system in the South, in which prisoners were leased in slave labor to corporations, used thus to depress the general level of wages and also to break strikes. In the year , miners of the Tennessee Coal Mine Company were asked to sign an ""iron- clad contract"": pledging no strikes, agreeing to get paid in scrip, and giving up the right to check the weight of the coal they mined . They refused to sign and were evicted from their houses. Convicts were brought in to replace them. On the night of October , , a thousand armed miners took control of the mine area, set five hundred convicts free, and burned down the stockades in which the convicts were kept. The companies surrendered, agreeing not to use convicts, not to require the ""ironclad contract/' and to let the miners check on the weight of the coal they mined. The following year, there were more such incidents in Tennessee. C. Vann Woodward calls them ""insurrections."" Miners overpowered guards of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company, burned the stockades, shipped the convicts to Nashville. Other unions in Tennessee came to their aid. An observer reported back to the Chattanooga Federation of Trades: I should like to impress upon people the extent of this movement. I have seen the written assurance of reinforcements to the miners of fully  men, who will be on the field in ten hours after the first shot is fired. . .. The entire district is as one over the main proposition, ""the convicts must go"". I counted  rifles on Monday as the miners passed, while the vast multitude following them carried revolvers. The captains of the different companies are all Grand Army men. Whites and Negroes are standing shoulder to shoulder. That same year, in New Orleans, forty-two union locals, with over twenty thousand members, mostly white but including some blacks , called a general strike, involving half the population of the city. Work in New Orleans came to a stop. After three days-with strikebreakers brought in, martial law, and the threat of militia-the strike ended with a compromise, gaining hours and wages but without recognition of the unions as bargaining agents. The year  saw strike struggles all over the country: besides the general strike in New Orleans and the coal miners' strike in Tennessee, there was a railroad switchmen's strike in Buffalo, New York, and a copper miners' strike in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The Coeur d'Alene strike was marked by gun battles between strikers and strikebreakers, and many deaths. A newspaper account of July , , reported: ... The long-dreaded conflict between the forces of the strikers and the nonunion men who have taken their places has come at last. As a result five men are known to be dead and  are already in the hospital; the Frisco mill on Canyon Creek is in ruins; the Gem mine has surrendered to the strikers, the arms of its employees have been captured, and the employees themselves have been ordered out of the country. Flushed with the success of these victories the turbulent element among the strikers are preparing to move upon other strongholds of the non-union men... . The National Guard, brought in by the governor, was reinforced by federal troops: six hundred miners were rounded up and imprisoned in bullpens, scabs brought back, union leaders fired, the strike broken. In early , the Carnegie Steel plant at Homestead, Pennsylvania, just outside of Pittsburgh, was being managed by Henry Clay Frick while Carnegie was in Europe. Frick decided to reduce the workers' wages and break their union. He built a fence  miles long and  feet high around the steelworks and topped it with barbed wire, adding peepholes for rifles. When the workers did not accept the pay cut, Frick laid off the entire work force. The Pinkerton detective agency was hired to protect strikebreakers. Although only  of the , workers at Homestead belonged to the union, three thousand workers met in the Opera House and voted overwhelmingly to strike. The plant was on the Monongahela River, and a thousand pickets began patrolling a -mile stretch of the river. A committee of strikers took over the town, and the sheriff was unable to raise a posse among local people against them. On the night of July , , hundreds of Pinkerton guards boarded barges  miles down the river from Homestead and moved toward the plant, where ten thousand strikers and sympathizers waited. The crowd warned the Pinkertons not to step off the barge. A striker lay down on the gangplank, and when a Pinkerton man tried to shove him aside, he fired, wounding the detective in the thigh. In the gunfire that followed on both sides, seven workers were killed. The Pinkertons had to retreat onto the barges. They were attacked from all sides, voted to surrender, and then were beaten by the enraged crowd. There were dead on both sides. For the next several days the strikers were in command of the area. Now the state went into action: the governor brought in the militia, armed with the latest rifles and Gatling guns, to protect the import of strikebreakers. Strike leaders were charged with murder;  other strikers were tried for other crimes. All were acquitted by friendly juries. The entire Strike Committee was then arrested for treason against the state, but no jury would convict them. The strike held for four months, but the plant was producing steel with strikebreakers who were brought in, often in locked trains, not knowing their destination, not knowing a strike was on. The strikers, with no resources left, agreed to return to work, their leaders blacklisted. One reason for the defeat was that the strike was confined to Homestead, and other plants of Carnegie kept working. Some blast furnace workers did strike, but they were quickly defeated, and the pig iron from those furnaces was then used at Homestead. The defeat kept unionization from the Carnegie plants well into the twentieth century, and the workers took wage cuts and increases in hours without organized resistance. In the midst of the Homestead strike, a young anarchist from New York named Alexander Berkman, in a plan prepared by anarchist friends in New York, including his lover Emma Goldman, came to Pittsburgh and entered the office of Henry Clay Frick, determined to kill him. Berkman's aim was poor; he wounded Frick and was overwhelmed, then was tried and found guilty of attempted murder. He served fourteen years in the state penitentiary. His Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist gave a graphic description of the assassination attempt and of his years in prison, when he changed his mind about the usefulness of assassinations but remained a dedicated revolutionary. Emma Goldman's autobiography, Living My Life, conveys the anger, the sense of injustice, the desire for a new kind of life, that grew among the young radicals of that day. The year  saw the biggest economic crisis in the country's history. After several decades of wild industrial growth, financial manipulation, uncontrolled speculation and profiteering, it all collapsed:  banks failed and , businesses closed down. Out of the labor force of  million,  million were unemployed. No state government voted relief, but mass demonstrations all over the country forced city governments to set up soup kitchens and give people work on streets or parks. In New York City, in Union Square, Emma Goldman addressed a huge meeting of the unemployed and urged those whose children needed food to go into the stores and take it. She was arrested for ""inciting to riot"" and sentenced to two years in prison. In Chicago, it was estimated that , people were without work, the floors and stairways of City Hall and the police stations packed every night with homeless men trying to sleep. The Depression lasted for years and brought a wave of strikes throughout the country. The largest of these was the nationwide strike of railroad workers in  that began at the Pullman Company in Illinois, just outside of Chicago. Annual wages of railroad workers, according to the report of the commissioner of labor in , were $ for engineers, the aristocrats of the railroad-but $ for conductors, $ for brakemen, and $ for laborers. Railroad work was one of the most dangerous jobs in America; over two thousand railroad workers were being killed each year, and thirty thousand injured. The railroad companies called these ""acts of God"" or the result of ""carelessness"" on the part of the workers, but the Locomotive Firemen's Magazine said: ""It comes to this: while railroad managers reduce their force and require men to do double duty, involving loss of rest and sleep . . . the accidents are chargeable to the greed of the corporation."" It was the Depression of  that propelled Eugene Debs into a lifetime of action for unionism and socialism. Debs was from Terre Haute, Indiana, where his father and mother ran a store. He had worked on the railroads for four years until he was nineteen, but left when a friend was killed after falling under a locomotive. He came back to join a Railroad Brotherhood as a billing clerk. At the time of the great strikes of , Debs opposed them and argued there was no ""necessary conflict between capital and labor."" But when he read Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward, it deeply affected him. He followed the events at Homestead, Coeur d'Alene, the Buffalo switchmen's strike, and wrote: If the year  taught the world any lesson worthy of heed, it was that the capitalist class, like a devilfish, had grasped them with its tentacles and was dragging them down to fathomless depths of degradation. To escape the prehensile clutch of these monsters, constitutes a standing challenge to organized labor for . In the midst of the economic crisis of , a small group of railroad workers, including Debs, formed the American Railway Union, to unite all railway workers. Debs said: A life purpose of mine has been the federation of railroad employees. To unify them into one great body is my object. . . . Class enrollment fosters class prejudices and class selfishness. ... It has been my life's desire to unify railroad employees and to eliminate the aristocracy of labor ... and organize them so all will be on an equality. ... Knights of Labor people came in, virtually merging the old Knights with the American Railway Union, according to labor historian David Montgomery. Debs wanted to include everyone, but blacks were kept out: at a convention in , the provision in the constitution barring blacks was affirmed by a vote of  to . Later, Debs thought this might have had a crucial effect on the outcome of the Pullman strike, for black workers were in no mood to cooperate with the strikers. In June , workers at the Pullman Palace Car Company went on strike. One can get an idea of the kind of support they got, mostly from the immediate vicinity of Chicago, in the first months of the strike, from a list of contributions put together by the Reverend William H. Carwardine, a Methodist pastor in the company town of Pullman for three years : Typographical Union # Painters and Decorators Union # Carpenters' Union No.  Thirty- fourth Ward Republican Club Grand Crossing Police Hyde Park Water Department Picnic at Gardener's Park Milk Dealer's Union Hyde Park Liquor Dealers Fourteenth Precinct Police Station Swedish Concert Chicago Fire Department German Singing Society Cheque from Anaconda, Montana The Pullman strikers appealed to a convention of the American Railway Union for support: Mr. President and Brothers of the American Railway Union. We struck at Pullman because we were without hope. We joined the American Railway Union because it gave us a glimmer of hope. Twenty thousand souls, men, women and little ones, have their eyes turned toward this convention today, straining eagerly through dark despondency for a glimmer of the heavensent message you alone can give us on this earth... . You all must know that the proximate cause of our strike was the discharge of two members of our grievance committee.... Five reductions in wages.. .. The last was the most severe, amounting to nearly thirty per cent, and rents had not fallen. .. . Water which Pullman buys from the city at  cents a thousand gallons he retails lo us at  percent advance. .. . Gas which sells at  cents per thousand feet in Hyde Park, just north of us, he sells for $.. When we went to tell him our grievances he said we were all his ""children."".. . Pullman, both the man and the town, is an ulcer on the body politic. He owns the houses, the schoolhouses, and churches of God in the town he gave his once humble name.... And thus the merry war-the dance of skeletons bathed in human tears-goes on, and it will go on, brothers, forever, unless you, the American Railway Union, stop it; end it; crush it out. The American Railway Union responded. It asked its members all over the country not to handle Pullman cars. Since virtually all passenger trains had Pullman cars, this amounted to a boycott of all trains-a nationwide strike. Soon all traffic on the twenty-four railroad lines leading out of Chicago had come to a halt. Workers derailed freight cars, blocked tracks, pulled engineers off trains if they refused to cooperate. The General Managers Association, representing the railroad owners, agreed to pay two thousand deputies, sent in to break the strike. But the strike went on. The Attorney General of the United States, Richard Olney, a former railroad lawyer, now got a court injunction against blocking trains, on the legal ground that the federal mails were being interfered with. When the strikers ignored the injunction, President Cleveland ordered federal troops to Chicago. On July , hundreds of cars were burned by strikers. The following day, the state militia moved in, and the Chicago Times reported on what followed: Company C. Second Regiment . . . disciplined a mob of rioters yesterday afternoon at Forty-ninth and Loomis Streets. The police assisted and . . . finished the job. There is no means of knowing how many rioters were killed or wounded. The mob carried off many of its dying and injured. A crowd of five thousand gathered. Rocks were thrown at the militia, and the command was given to fire. ... To say that the mob went wild is but a weak expression.. . . The command to charge was given. . .. From that moment only bayonets were used. ... A dozen men in the front line of rioters received bayonet wounds. . .. Tearing up cobble stones, the mob made a determined charge.... the word was passed along the line for each officer to take care of himself. One by one, as occasion demanded, they fired point blank into the crowd.. .. The police followed with their clubs. A wire fence enclosed the track. The rioters had forgotten it; when they turned to fly they were caught in a trap. The police were not inclined to be merciful, and driving the mob against the barbed wires clubbed it unmercifully. .. . The crowd outside the fence rallied to the assistance of the rioters.... The shower of stones was incessant. . .. The ground over which the fight had occurred was like a battlefield. The men shot by the troops and police lay about like logs.. .. In Chicago that day, thirteen people were killed, fifty-three seriously wounded, seven hundred arrested. Before the strike was over, perhaps thirty-four were dead. With fourteen thousand police, militia, troops in Chicago, the strike was crushed. Debs was arrested for contempt of court, for violating the injunction that said he could not do or say anything to carry on the strike. He told the court: ""It seems to me that if it were not for resistance to degrading conditions, the tendency of our whole civilization would be downward; after a while we would reach the point where there would be no resistance, and slavery would come."" Debs, in court, denied he was a socialist. But during his six months in prison, he studied socialism and talked to fellow prisoners who were socialists. Later he wrote: ""I was to be baptized in Socialism in the roar of conflict... in the gleam of every bayonet and the flash of every rifle the class struggle was revealed. ... This was my first practical struggle in Socialism."" Two years after he came out of prison, Debs wrote in the Railway Times: The issue is Socialism versus Capitalism. I am for Socialism because I am for humanity. We have been cursed with the reign of gold long enough. Money constitutes no proper basis of civilization. The time has come to regenerate society-we are on the eve of a universal change. Thus, the eighties and nineties saw bursts of labor insurrection, more organized than the spontaneous strikes of . There were now revolutionary movements influencing labor struggles, the ideas of socialism affecting labor leaders. Radical literature was appearing, speaking of fundamental changes, of new possibilities for living. In this same period, those who worked on the land-farmers, North and South, black and white-were going far beyond the scattered tenant protests of the pre-Civil War years and creating the greatest movement of agrarian rebellion the country had ever seen. When the Homestead Act was being discussed in Congress in , a Senator from Wisconsin said he supported it: .. . because its benign operation will postpone for centuries, if it will not forever, all serious conflict between capital and labor in the older free States, withdrawing their surplus population to create in greater abundance the means of subsistence. The Homestead Act did not have that effect. It did not bring tranquility to the East by moving Americans to the West. It was not a safety valve for discontent, which was too great to be contained that way. As Henry Nash Smith says , and as we have seen: ""On the contrary, the three decades following its passage were marked by the most bitter and widespread labor trouble that had yet been seen in the United States."" It also failed to bring peace to the farm country of the West. Hamlin Garland, who made so many Americans aware of the life of the farmer, wrote in the preface to his novel Jason Edwards: 'Tree land is gone. The last acre of available farmland has now passed into private or corporate hands."" In Jason Edwards a Boston mechanic takes his family West, drawn by advertising circulars. But he finds that all land within  miles of a railroad has been taken up by speculators. He struggles for five years to pay off a loan and get title to his farm, and then a storm destroys his wheat just before harvest. Behind the despair so often registered in the farm country literature of that day, there must have been visions, from time to time, of a different way to live. In another Garland novel, A Spoil of Office, the heroine speaks at a farmers' picnic: I see a time when the farmer will not need to live in a cabin on a lonely farm. I see the farmers coming together in groups. I see them with time to read, and time to visit with their fellows. I see them enjoying lectures in beautiful halls, erected in every village. I see them gather like the Saxons of old upon the green at evening to sing and dance. I see cities rising near them with schools, and churches, and concert halls and theaters. I see a day when the farmer will no longer be a drudge and his wife a bond slave, but happy men and women who will go singing to their pleasant tasks upon their fruitful farms. When the boys and girls will not go west nor to the city; when life will be worth living. In that day the moon will be brighter and the stars more glad, and pleasure and poetry and love of life come back to the man who tills the soil. Hamlin Garland dedicated Jason Edwards, written in , to the Farmers Alliance. It was the Farmers Alliance that was the core of the great movement of the s and s later known as the Populist Movement. Between  and , the U.S. army, wiping out the Indian villages on the Great Plains, paved the way for the railroads to move in and take the best land. Then the farmers came for what was left. From  to  the population of the United States grew from  million to  million; now  million people lived west of the Mississippi, and the number of farms grew from  million to  million. With the crowded cities of the East needing food, the internal market for food was more than doubled;  percent of the farm produce was sold inside the United States. Farming became mechanized-steel plows, mowing machines, reapers, harvesters, improved cotton gins for pulling the fibers away from the seed, and, by the turn of the century, giant combines that cut the grain, threshed it, and put it in bags. In  a bushel of wheat had taken three hours to produce. By , it took ten minutes. Specialization developed by region: cotton and tobacco in the South, wheat and corn in the Midwest. Land cost money, and machines cost money-so farmers had to borrow, hoping that the prices of their harvests would stay high, so they could pay the bank for the loan, the railroad for transportation, the grain merchant for handling their grain, the storage elevator for storing it. But they found the prices for their produce going down, and the prices of transportation and loans going up, because the individual farmer could not control the price of his grain, while the monopolist railroad and the monopolist banker could charge what they liked. William Faulkner, in his novel The Hamlet, described the man on whom southern farmers depended: He was the largest landholder ... in one county, and Justice of the Peace in the next, and election commissioner in both.... He was a farmer, a usurer, a veterinarian.... He owned most of the good land in the county and held mortgages on most of the rest. He owned the store and the cotton gin and the combined grist mill and blacksmith shop.. .. The farmers who could not pay saw their homes and land taken away. They became tenants. By ,  percent of all farms were rented by tenants, and the number kept rising. Many did not even have money to rent and became farm laborers; by  there were  / million farm laborers in the country. It was the fate that awaited every farmer who couldn't pay his debts. Could the squeezed and desperate farmer turn to the government for help? Lawrence Goodwyn, in his study of the Populist movement , says that after the Civil War both parties now were controlled by capitalists. They were divided along North-South lines, still hung over with the animosities of the Civil War. This made it very hard to create a party of reform cutting across both parties to unite working people South and North-to say nothing of black and white, foreign-born and native-born. The government played its part in helping the bankers and hurting the farmers; it kept the amount of money-based on the gold supply- steady, while the population rose, so there was less and less money in circulation. The farmer had to pay off his debts in dollars that were harder to get. The bankers, getting the loans back, were getting dollars worth more than when they loaned them out-a kind of interest on top of interest. That is why so much of the talk of farmers' movements in those days had to do with putting more money in circulation-by printing greenbacks  or by making silver a basis for issuing money. It was in Texas that the Farmers Alliance movement began. It was in the South that the crop-lien system was most brutal. By this system the farmer would get the things he needed from the merchant: the use of the cotton gin at harvest time, whatever supplies were necessary. He didn't have money to pay, so the merchant would get a lien-a mortgage on his crop-on which the farmer might pay  percent interest. Goodwyn says ""the crop lien system became for millions of Southerners, white and black, little more than a modified form of slavery."" The man with the ledger became to the farmer ""the furnishing man,"" to black farmers simply ""the Man."" The farmer would owe more money every year until finally his farm was taken away and he became a tenant. Goodwyn gives two personal histories to illustrate this. A white farmer in South Carolina, between  and , bought goods and services from the furnishing merchant for $,. but was able to pay only $., and finally he had to give his land to the merchant. A black farmer named Matt Brown, in Black Hawk, Mississippi, between  and , bought his supplies from the Jones store, kept falling further and further behind, and in  the last entry in the merchant's ledger is for a coffin and burial supplies. How many rebellions took place against this system we don't know. In Delhi, Louisiana, in , a gathering of small farmers rode into town and demolished the stores of merchants ""to cancel their indebtedness,"" they said. In the height of the  Depression, a group of white farmers gathered together on a farm in Texas and formed the first ""Farmers Alliance."" In a few years, it was across the state. By , there were  suballiances in twelve counties. By , , farmers had joined in two thousand suballiances. They began to offer alternatives to the old system: join the Alliance and form cooperatives; buy things together and get lower prices. They began putting their cotton together and selling it cooperatively-they called it ""bulking."" In some states a Grange movement developed; it managed to get laws passed to help farmers. But the Grange, as one of its newspapers put it, ""is essentially conservative and furnishes a stable, well- organized, rational and orderly opposition to encroachments upon the liberties of the people, in contrast to the lawless, desperate attempts of communism."" It was a time of crisis, and the Grange was doing too little. It lost members, while the Farmers Alliance kept growing. From the beginning, the Farmers Alliance showed sympathy with the growing labor movement. When Knights of Labor men went on strike against a steamship line in Galveston, Texas, one of the radical leaders of the Texas Alliance, William Lamb, spoke for many  Alliance members when he said in an open letter to Alliance people: ""Knowing that the day is not far distant when the Farmers Alliance will have to use Boycott on manufacturers in order to get goods direct, we think it is a good time to help the Knights of Labor. . .."" Goodwyn says: ""Alliance radicalism- Populism-began with this letter."" The Texas Alliance president opposed joining the boycott, but a group of Alliance people in Texas passed a resolution: Whereas we see the unjust encroachments that the capitalists are making upon all the different departments of labor ... we extend to the Knights of Labor our hearty sympathy in their manly struggle against monopolistic oppression and ... we propose to stand by the Knights. In the summer of , in the town of Cleburne, near Dallas, the Alliance gathered and drew up what came to be known as the ""Cleburne Demands""-the first document of the Populist movement, asking ""such legislation as shall secure to our people freedom from the onerous and shameful abuses that the industrial classes are now suffering at the hands of arrogant capitalists and powerful corporations."" They called for a national conference of all labor organizations ""to discuss such measures as may be of interest to the laboring classes,"" and proposed regulation of railroad rates, heavy taxation of land held only for speculative purposes, and an increase in the money supply. The Alliance kept growing. By early , it had , members in three thousand suballiances. By  farmer lecturers had gone into forty-three states and reached  million farm families in what Goodwyn calls ""the most massive organizing drive by any citizen institution of nineteenth century America,"" It was a drive based on the idea of cooperation, of farmers creating their own culture, their own political parties, gaining a respect not given them by the nation's powerful industrial and political leaders. Organizers from Texas came to Georgia to form alliances, and in three years Georgia had , members in  of the  counties. In Tennessee, there were soon , members and , suballiances in ninety-two of the state's ninety-six counties. The Alliance moved into Mississippi ""like a cyclone,"" someone said, and into Louisiana and North Carolina. Then northward into Kansas and the Dakotas, where thirty-five cooperative warehouses were set up. One of the leading figures in Kansas was Henry Vincent, who started a journal in  called The American Nonconformist and Kansas Industrial Liberator, saying in the first issue: This journal will aim to publish such matter as will tend to the education of the laboring classes, the farmers and the producer, and in every struggle it will endeavor to take the side of the oppressed as against the oppressor.. .. By , the Kansas Alliance had fifty thousand members and was electing local candidates to office. Now there were , members in the National Farmers Alliance. And the conditions spurring the Alliance onward got worse. Corn which had brought  cents a bushel in  brought  cents a bushel in . Harvesting wheat required a machine to bind the wheat before it became too dry, and this cost several hundred dollars, which the farmer had to buy on credit, knowing the $ would be twice as hard to get in a few years. Then he had pay a bushel of corn in freight costs for every bushel he shipped. He had to pay the high prices demanded by the grain elevators at the terminals. In the South the situation was worse than anywhere- percent of the farmers lived on credit. To meet this situation, the Texas Alliance formed a statewide cooperative, a great Texas Exchange, which handled the selling of the farmers' cotton in one great transaction. But the Exchange itself needed loans to advance credit to its members; the banks refused. A call was issued to farmers to scrape together the needed capital for the Exchange to operate. Thousands came on June , , to two hundred Texas courthouses and made their contributions, pledging $,. Ultimately, $, was actually collected. It was not enough. The farmers' poverty prevented them from helping themselves. The banks won, and this persuaded the Alliances that monetary reform was crucial. There was one victory along the way. Farmers were being charged too much for jute bags , which were controlled by a trust. The Alliance farmers organized a boycott of jute, made their own bags out of cotton, and forced the jute manufacturers to start selling their bags at  cents a yard instead of  cents. The complexity of Populist belief was shown in one of its important leaders in Texas, Charles Macune. He was a radical in economics , a conservative in politics , and a racist. Macune came forward with a plan that was to become central to the Populist platform-the sub-Treasury plan. The government would have its own warehouses where farmers would store produce and get certificates from this sub-Treasury. These would be greenbacks, and thus much more currency would be made available, not dependent on gold or silver, but based on the amount of farm produce. There were more Alliance experiments. In the Dakotas, a great cooperative insurance plan for farmers insured them against loss of their crops. Where the big insurance companies had asked  cents an acre, the cooperative asked  cents or less. It issued thirty thousand policies, covering  million acres. Macune's sub-Treasury plan depended on the government. And since it would not be taken up by the two major parties, it meant  organizing a third party. The Alliances went to work. In  thirty-eight Alliance people were elected to Congress. In the South, the Alliance elected governors in Georgia and Texas. It took over the Democratic party in Georgia and won three-fourths of the seats in the Georgia legislature, six of Georgia's ten congressmen. This was, however, Goodwyn says, ""an elusive revolution, because the party machinery remained in the hands of the old crowd, and the crucial chairmanships of important committees, in Congress, in the state legislatures, remained in the hands of the conservatives, and corporate power, in the states, in the nation, could use its money to still get what it wanted."" The Alliances were not getting real power, but they were spreading new ideas and a new spirit. Now, as a political party, they became the People's party , and met in convention in  in Topeka, Kansas. The great Populist orator from that state, Mary Ellen Lease, told an enthusiastic crowd: Wall Street owns the country. It is no longer a government of the people, by the people, and for the people, but a government of Wall Street, by Wall Street and for Wall Street.... Our laws are the output of a system which clothes rascals in robes and honesty in rags. . .. the politicians said we suffered from overproduction. Overproduction, when , little children . .. starve to death every year in the U.S. and over , shop girls in New York are forced to sell their virtue for bread. ,.. There are thirty men in the United States whose aggregate wealth is over one and one-half billion dollars. There are half a million looking for work.. .. We want money, land and transportation. We want the abolition of the National Banks, and we want the power to make loans direct from the government. We want the accursed foreclosure system wiped out. . . . We will stand by our homes and stay by our firesides by force if necessary, and we will not pay our debts to the loan-shark companies until the Government pays its debts to us. The people are at bay, let the bloodhounds of money who have dogged us thus far beware. At the People's party national convention in  in St. Louis, a platform was drawn up. The preamble was written by, and read to the assemblage by, another of the great orators of the movement, Ignatius Donnelly: We meet in the midst of a nation brought to the verge of moral, political and material ruin. Corruption dominates the ballot box, the legislatures, the Congress, and touches even the ermine of the bench. These people are demoralized. . .. The newspapers are subsidized or muzzled; public opinion silenced; business prostrate, our homes covered with mortgages, labor impoverished, and the land concentrating in the hands of capitalists. The urban workmen are denied the right of organization for self-protection; imported pauperized labor beats down their wages; a hireling standing army . .. established to shoot them down... . The fruits of the toil of millions are boldly stolen to build up colossal fortunes. . .. From the same prolific womb of governmental injustice we breed two classes-paupers and millionaires... . A People's party nominating convention in Omaha in July of  nominated James Weaver, an Iowa Populist and former general in the Union army, for President. The Populist movement was now tied to the voting system. Their spokesman Polk had said they could ""link their hands and hearts together and march to the ballot box and take possession of the government, restore it to the principles of our fathers, and run it in the interest of the people."" Weaver got over a million votes, but lost. A new political party had the job of uniting diverse groups-northern Republicans and southern Democrats, urban workers and country farmers, black and white. A Colored Farmers National Alliance grew in the South and had perhaps a million members, but it was organized and led by whites. There were also black organizers, but it was not easy for them to persuade black farmers that, even if economic reforms were won, blacks would have equal access to them. Blacks had tied themselves to the Republican party, the party of Lincoln and civil rights laws. The Democrats were the party of slavery and segregation. As Goodwyn puts it, ""in an era of transcendent white prejudice, the curbing of 'vicious corporate monopoly' did not carry for black farmers the ring of salvation it had for white agrarians."" There were whites who saw the need for racial unity. One Alabama newspaper wrote: The white and colored Alliance are united in their war against trusts, and in the promotion of the doctrine that farmers should establish cooperative stores, and manufactures, and publish their own newspapers, conduct their own schools, and have a hand in everything else that concerns them as citizens or affects them personally or collectively. The official newspaper of the Alabama Knights of Labor, the Alabama Sentinel, wrote: ""The Bourbon Democracy are trying to down the Alliance with the old cry 'nigger'. It won't work though."" Some Alliance blacks made similar calls for unity. A leader of the Florida Colored Alliance said: ""We are aware of the fact that the laboring colored man's interests and the laboring white man's interest are one and the same."" When the Texas People's party was founded in Dallas in the summer of , it was interracial, and radical. There was blunt and vigorous debate among whites and blacks. A black delegate, active in the Knights of Labor, dissatisfied with vague statements about ""equality,"" said: If we are equal, why does not the sheriff summon Negroes on juries? And why hang up the sign ""Negro"", in passenger cars. I want to tell my people what the People's Party is going to do. I want to tell them if it is going to work a black and white horse in the same field. A white leader responded by urging there be a black delegate from every district in the state. ""They are in the ditch just like we are."" When someone suggested there be separate white and black Populist clubs which would ""confer together,"" R. M. Humphrey, the white leader of the Colored Alliance, objected: ""This will not do. The colored people are part of the people and they must be recognized as such."" Two blacks were then elected to the state executive committee of the party. Blacks and whites were in different situations. The blacks were mostly field hands, hired laborers; most white Alliance people were farm owners. When the Colored Alliance declared a strike in the cotton fields in  for a dollar a day wages for cotton pickers, Leonidas Polk, head of the white Alliance, denounced it as hurting the Alliance farmer who would have to pay that wage. In Arkansas, a thirty-year-old black cotton picker named Ben Patterson led the strike, traveling from plantation to plantation to get support, his band growing, engaging in gun battles with a white posse. A plantation manager was killed, a cotton gin burned. Patterson and his band were caught, and fifteen of them were shot to death. There was some black-white unity at the ballot box in the South- resulting in a few blacks elected in North Carolina local elections. An Alabama white farmer wrote to a newspaper in : ""I wish to God that Uncle Sam could put bayonets around the ballot box in the black belt on the first Monday in August so that the Negro could get a fair vote."" There were black delegates to third- party conventions in Georgia: two in , twenty-four in , The Arkansas People's party platform spoke for the ""downtrodden, regardless of race."" There were moments of racial unity. Lawrence Goodwyn found in east Texas an unusual coalition of black and white public officials: it had begun during Reconstruction and continued into the Populist period. The state government was in the control of white Democrats, but in Grimes County, blacks won local offices and sent legislators to the state capital. The district clerk was a black man; there were black deputy sheriffs and a black school principal. A night-riding White Man's Union used intimidation and murder to split the coalition, but Goodwyn points to ""the long years of interracial cooperation in Grimes County"" and wonders about missed opportunities. Racism was strong, and the Democratic party played on this, winning many farmers from the Populist party. When white tenants, failing in the crop-lien system, were evicted from their land and replaced by blacks, race hatred intensified. Southern states were drawing up new constitutions, starting with Mississippi in , to prevent blacks from voting by various devices, and to maintain ironclad segregation in every aspect of life. The laws that took the vote away from blacks-poll taxes, literacy tests, property qualifications-also often ensured that poor whites would not vote. And the political leaders of the South knew this. At the constitutional convention in Alabama, one of the leaders said he wanted to take away the vote from ""all those who are unfit and unqualified, and if the rule strikes a white man as well as a negro let him go."" In North Carolina, the Charlotte Observer saw disfranchisement as ""the struggle of the white people of North Carolina to rid themselves of the dangers of the rule of negroes and the lower class of whites."" Tom Watson, the Populist leader of Georgia, pleaded for racial unity: You are kept apart that you may be separately fleeced of your earnings. You are made to hate each other because upon that hatred is rested the keystone of the arch of financial despotism which enslaves you both. You are deceived and blinded that you may not see how this race antagonism perpetuates a monetary system which beggars both. According to the black scholar Robert Alien, taking a look at Populism , Watson wanted black support for a white man's party. No doubt, when Watson found this support embarrassing and no longer useful, he became as eloquent in affirming racism as he had been in opposing it. Still, Watson must have addressed some genuine feelings in poor whites whose class oppression gave them some common interest with blacks. When H. S. Doyle, a young black preacher who supported Watson for Congress, was threatened by a lynch mob, he came to Watson for protection, and two thousand white farmers helped Doyle escape. It was a time that illustrated the complexities of class and race conflict. Fifteen blacks were lynched during Watson's election campaign. And in Georgia after  the Alliance-controlled legislature, Alien points out, ""passed the largest number of anti-black bills ever enacted in a single year in Georgia history."" And yet, in , the Georgia state platform of the People's party denounced lynch law and terrorism, and asked the abolition of the convict lease system. C. Vann Woodward points to the unique quality of the Populist experience in the South: ""Never before or since have the two races in the South come so close together as they did during the Populist struggles."" The Populist movement also made a remarkable attempt to create a new and independent culture for the country's farmers. The Alliance Lecture Bureau reached all over the country; it had , lecturers. The Populists poured out books and pamphlets from their printing presses. Woodward says: One gathers from yellowed pamphlets that the agrarian ideologists undertook to re-educate their countrymen from the ground up. Dismissing ""history as taught in our schools"" as ""practically valueless"", they undertook to write it over-formidable columns of it, from the Greek down. With no more compunction they turned all hands to the revision of economics, political theory, law, and government. The National Economist, a Populist magazine, had , readers. Goodwyn counts over a thousand Populist journals in the s. There were newspapers like the Comrade, published in the cotton country of Louisiana, and the Toiler's Friend, in rural Georgia. Also, Revolution was published in Georgia. In North Carolina, the Populist printing plant was burned. In Alabama, there was the Living Truth. It was broken into in , its type scattered, and the next year the shop was set afire, but the press survived and the editor never missed an issue. Hundreds of poems and songs came out of the Populist movement, like ""The Farmer Is the Man"": . . . the farmer is the man The Farmer is the man Lives on credit till the fall With the interest rates so high It's a wonder he don't die And the mortgage man's the one That gets it all. The farmer is the man The farmer is the man Lives on credit till the fall And his pants are wearing thin His condition it's a sin He's forgot that he's the man That feeds them all. Books written by Populist leaders, such as Henry Demarest Lloyd's Wealth Against Commonwealth, and William Harvey Coin's Financial School, were widely read. An Alabama historian of that time, William Garrott Brown, said about the Populist movement that ""no other political movement-not that of , nor that of --ever altered Southern life so profoundly."" According to Lawrence Goodwyn, if the labor movement had been able to do in the cities what the Populists did in the rural areas, ""to create among urban workers a culture of cooperation, self- respect, and economic analysis,"" there might have been a great movement for change in the United States. There were only fitful, occasional connections between the farmer and labor movements. Neither spoke eloquently enough to the other's needs. And yet, there were signs of a common consciousness that might, under different circumstances, lead to a unified, ongoing movement. Norman Pollack says, on the basis of a close study of midwestern Populist newspapers, that ""Populism regarded itself as a class movement, reasoning that farmers and workers were assuming the same material position in society."" An editorial in the Farmers' Alliance spoke of a man working fourteen to sixteen hours a day: ""He is brutalized both morally and physically. He has no ideas, only propensities, he has no beliefs, only instincts."" Pollack sees that as a homespun version of Marx's idea of workers' alienation from his human self under capitalism, and finds many other parallels between Populist and Marxist ideas. Undoubtedly, Populists, along with most white Americans, had racism and nativism in their thinking. But part of it was that they simply did not think race as important as the economic system. Thus, the Farmers' Alliance said: ""The people's party has sprung into existence not to make the black man free, but to emancipate all men ... to gain for all industrial freedom, without which there can be no political freedom. . . ."" More important than theoretical connections were the Populist expressions of support for workers in actual struggles. The Alliance-Independent of Nebraska, during the great strike at the Carnegie steel plant, wrote: ""All who look beneath the surface will see that the bloody battle fought at Homestead was a mere incident in the great conflict between capital and labor."" Coxey's march of the unemployed drew sympathy in the farm areas; in Osceola, Nebraska, perhaps five thousand people attended a picnic in Coxey's honor. During the Pullman strike, a farmer wrote to the governor of Kansas: ""Unquestionably, nearly, if not quite all Alliance people are in fullest sympathy with these striking men."" On top of the serious failures to unite blacks and whites, city workers and country farmers, there was the lure of electoral politics-all of that combining to destroy the Populist movement. Once allied with the Democratic party in supporting William Jennings Bryan for President in , Populism would drown in a sea of Democratic politics. The pressure for electoral victory led Populism to make deals with the major parties in city after city. If the Democrats won, it would be absorbed. If the Democrats lost, it would disintegrate. Electoral polities brought into the top leadership the political brokers instead of the agrarian radicals. There were those radical Populists who saw this. They said fusion with the Democrats to try to ""win"" would lose what they needed, an independent political movement. They said the much- ballyhooed free silver would not change anything fundamental in the capitalist system. One Texas radical said silver coinage would ""leave undisturbed all the conditions which give rise to the undue concentration of wealth."" Henry Demarest Lloyd noted that the Bryan nomination was subsidized in part by Marcus Daly  and William Randolph Hearst . He saw through the rhetoric of Bryan that stirred the crowd of twenty thousand at the Democratic Convention . Lloyd wrote bitterly: The poor people are throwing up their hats in the air for those who promise to lead them out of the wilderness by way of the currency route. . .. The people are to be kept wandering forty years in the currency labyrinth, as they have for the last forty years been led up and down the tariff bill. In the election of , with the Populist movement enticed into the Democratic party, Bryan, the Democratic candidate, was defeated by William McKinley, for whom the corporations and the press mobilized, in the first massive use of money in an election campaign. Even the hint of Populism in the Democratic party, it seemed, could not be tolerated, and the big guns of the Establishment pulled out all their ammunition, to make sure. It was a time, as election times have often been in the United States, to consolidate the system after years of protest and rebellion. The black was being kept under control in the South. The Indian was being driven off the western plains for good; on a cold winter day in , U.S. army soldiers attacked Indians camped at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, and killed three hundred men, women, and children. It was the climax to four hundred years of violence that began with Columbus, establishing that this continent belonged to white men. But only to certain white men, because it was clear by  that the state stood ready to crush labor strikes, by the law if possible, by force if necessary. And where a threatening mass movement developed, the two-party system stood ready to send out one of its columns to surround that movement and drain it of vitality. And always, as a way of drowning class resentment in a flood of slogans for national unity, there was patriotism. McKinley had said, in a rare rhetorical connection between money and flag: ... this year is going to be a year of patriotism and devotion to country. I am glad to know that the people in every part of the country mean to be devoted to one flag, the glorious Stars and Stripes; that the people of this country mean to maintain the financial honor of the country as sacredly as they maintain the honor of the flag. The supreme act of patriotism was war. Two years after McKinley became President, the United States declared war on Spain."

0zUb5MPkQCcDxqTkXiEIud,"IT’S A SUNDAY AFTERNOON in Tribeca, and I’m in Taylor Swift’s loft, inside a former printing house that she has restored and fortified into a sanctuary of brick, velvet, and mahogany. The space is warm and cozy and vaguely literary—later, when we pass through her bedroom en route to her garden,  percent of my brain will believe her wardrobe might open up to Narnia. Barefoot in a wine-colored floral top and matching flowy pants, Swift is typing passwords into a laptop to show me the video for “You Need to Calm Down,” eight days before she unleashes it on the world. I have a sliver of an idea what to expect. A few weeks earlier, I spent a day at the video shoot, in a dusty field-slash-junkyard north of Los Angeles. Swift had made it a sort of Big Gay Candy Mountain trailer park, a Technicolor happy place. The cast and crew wore heart-shaped sunglasses—living, breathing lovey-eyes emoji—and a mailbox warned, LOVE LETTERS ONLY. Swift and a stream of costars filmed six scenes over about a dozen hours. The singer-songwriter Hayley Kiyoko, known to her fans as “Lesbian Jesus,” shot arrows at a bull’s-eye. The YouTube comedian-chef Hannah Hart danced alongside Dexter Mayfield, the plus-size male model and self-described “big boy in heels.” The Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon served up icy red snow cones. Swift and her close friend Todrick Hall, of Kinky Boots and RuPaul’s Drag Race, sipped tea with the cast of Queer Eye. The mood was joyous and laid-back. But by the end of the day, I wasn’t sure what the vignettes would add up to. There were shoot days and cameos I wouldn’t observe. For security reasons, the song was never played aloud.  Even the hero shot, in which Swift and Hall sauntered arm in arm through the dreamscape at golden hour, was filmed in near-total silence. For weeks afterward, I tried to sleuth out a theory. I started casually. There was a “” on the bull’s-eye, so I did a quick search to figure out what that number might mean. Immediately I was in over my head. Swift has a thing for symbols. I knew she had been embedding secret messages in liner notes and deploying metaphors as refrains since her self-titled debut in —long before her megafame made her into a symbol of pop supremacy. But I hadn’t understood how coded and byzantine her body of work has become; I hadn’t learned, as Swift’s fans have, to see hidden meanings everywhere. For instance: In the  video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” a headstone in a graveyard scene reads NILS SJOBERG, the pseudonym Swift used as her writing credit on Rihanna’s hit “This Is What You Came For,” a Swedish-sounding nod to that country’s pop wizards. After an excessive amount of ad hoc scholarship—a friend joked that I could have learned Mandarin in the time I spent trying to unpack Swift’s oeuvre—I was no closer to a theory. Pop music has become so layered and meta, but the Taylor Swift Universe stands apart. Apprehending it is like grasping quantum physics. My first indication of what her new album, Lover, would be about came just after midnight on June , the beginning of Pride Month, when Swift introduced a petition in support of the federal Equality Act. This legislation would amend the Civil Rights Act to outlaw discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.  Swift also posted a letter to Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, asking him to vote yes. The request, on her personal letterhead , denounced President Trump for not supporting the Equality Act. “I personally reject the president’s stance,” Swift wrote. Back in the kitchen, Swift hits play. “The first verse is about trolls and cancel culture,” she says. “The second verse is about homophobes and the people picketing outside our concerts. The third verse is about successful women being pitted against each other.” The video is, for erudite Swifties, a rich text. I had followed enough clues to correctly guess some of the other cameos—Ellen DeGeneres, RuPaul, Katy Perry. I felt the satisfaction of a gamer who successfully levels up—achievement unlocked! The video’s final frame sends viewers to Swift’s change.org petition in support of the Equality Act, which has acquired more than , signatures—including those of Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke, and Kirsten Gillibrand—or four times the number required to elicit an official response from the White House. “Maybe a year or two ago, Todrick and I are in the car, and he asked me, What would you do if your son was gay?” We are upstairs in Swift’s secret garden, comfortably ensconced in a human-scale basket that is sort of shaped like a cocoon. Swift has brought up an ornate charcuterie board and is happily slathering triple-cream Brie onto sea-salt crackers. “The fact that he had to ask me . . . shocked me and made me realize that I had not made my position clear enough or loud enough,” she says. “If my son was gay, he’d be gay. I don’t understand the question.” I have pressed Swift on this topic, and her answers have been direct, not performative or scripted. I do sense that she enjoys talking to me about as much as she’d enjoy a root canal—but she’s unfailingly polite, and when we turn to music, her face will light up and she will add little melodic phrases to her speech, clearly her preferred language. If he was thinking that, I can’t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ community might be thinking,” she goes on. “It was kind of devastating to realize that I hadn’t been publicly clear about that.” I understand why she was surprised; she has been sending pro-LGBTQ signals since at least . Many have been subtle, but none insignificant—especially for a young country star coming out of Nashville. In the video for her single “Mean” , we see a boy in a school locker room wearing a lavender sweater and bow tie, surrounded by football players. In “Welcome to New York,” the first track on , she sings, “And you can want who you want. Boys and boys and girls and girls.” Two years later, she donated to a fund for the newly created Stonewall National Monument and presented Ruby Rose with a GLAAD Media Award. Every night of last year’s Reputation tour, she dedicated the song “Dress” to Loie Fuller, the openly gay pioneer of modern dance and theatrical lighting who captured the imagination of fin-de-siècle Paris. Swift, who has been criticized for keeping her politics to herself, first took an explicit stance a month before the  midterms. On Instagram, she endorsed Democrats for the Tennessee Legislature and called out the Republican running for Senate, Marsha Blackburn. “She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples,” Swift wrote. “She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.” Swift says the post was partly to help young fans understand that if they wanted to vote, they had to register. To tell them, as she puts it, “Hey, just so you know, you can’t just roll up.” Some , new voters registered in the first  hours after her post, according to Vote.org. Trump came to Blackburn’s defense the following day. “She’s a tremendous woman,” he told reporters. “I’m sure Taylor Swift doesn’t know anything about her. Let’s say I like Taylor’s music about  percent less now, OK?” In April, spurred by a raft of anti-LGBTQ bills in Tennessee, Swift donated $, to the Tennessee Equality Project, which advocates for LGBTQ rights. “Horrendous,” she says of the legislation. “They don’t call it ‘Slate of Hate’ for nothing.” Swift especially liked that the Tennessee Equality Project had organized a petition of faith leaders in opposition. “I loved how smart it was to come at it from a religious perspective.” Meanwhile, the “Calm Down” video provoked a Colorado pastor to call Swift “a sinner in desperate need of a savior” and warn that “God will cut her down.” It also revived heated debate within LGBTQ communities about the politics of allyship and corporatization of Pride. Some critics argued Swift’s pro-LGBTQ imagery and lyrics were overdue and out of the blue—a reaction the new Swift scholar in me found bewildering. Had they not been paying attention? Nor did it strike me as out of character for Swift to leverage her power for a cause. She pulled her catalog from Spotify in  over questions of artist compensation. She stared down Apple in , when the company said it would not pay artists during the launch of its music service.  As a condition of her record deal with Universal Music Group last year, the company promised that it would distribute proceeds from any sale of its Spotify shares to all of its artists. And this summer, Swift furiously called out Scott Borchetta, founder of Big Machine Label Group, for selling her master recordings to the music manager Scooter Braun.  Swift’s blunt testimony during her  sexual-assault case against a radio DJ—months before the #MeToo reckoning blew open—felt deeply political to me and, I imagine, many other women. Swift accused the DJ, David Mueller, of groping her under her skirt at a photo session in . Her camp reported the incident to his employer, who fired him. Mueller denied the allegation, sued Swift for $ million, and his case was thrown out. Swift countersued for a symbolic $ and won. In a Colorado courtroom, Swift described the incident: “He stayed latched onto my bare ass cheek” as photos were being snapped. Asked why photos of the front of her skirt didn’t show this, she said, “Because my ass is located at the back of my body.” Asked if she felt bad about the DJ’s losing his job, she said, “I’m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions—not mine.” When Time included Swift on the cover of its “Silence Breakers” issue that year, the magazine asked how she felt during the testimony. “I was angry,” she said. “In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened...I’m told it was the most amount of times the word ass has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.” Mueller has since paid Swift the dollar—with a Sacagawea coin. “He was trolling me, implying that I was self-righteous and hell-bent on angry, vengeful feminism. That’s what I’m inferring from him giving me a Sacagawea coin,” Swift says. “Hey, maybe he was trying to do it in honor of a powerful Native American woman. I didn’t ask.” Where is the coin now? “My lawyer has it.” I ask her, why get louder about LGBTQ rights now? “Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male,” she says. “I didn’t realize until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of. It’s hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. Because my mistakes are very loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world. It’s clickbait, and it’s a part of my life story, and it’s a part of my career arc.” I’d argue that no heterosexual woman can listen to “You Need to Calm Down” and hear only a gay anthem. “Calm down” is what controlling men tell women who are angry, contrary, or “hysterical,” or, let’s say, fearing for their physical safety. It is what Panic! at the Disco singer Brendon Urie says to Swift in the beginning of the “ME!” music video, prompting her to scream, “Je suis calme!” I cannot believe it is a coincidence that Swift, a numbers geek with an affinity for dates, dropped the single—whose slow, incessant bass is likely to be bumping in stadiums across the world in  if she goes on tour—on June , a certain president’s birthday. It’s enlightening to read  years of Taylor Swift coverage—all the big reviews, all the big profiles—in one sitting. You notice things. How quickly Swift went from a “prodigy”  and a “songwriting savant”  to a tabloid fixture, for instance. Or how suspect her ambition is made to seem once she acquires real power. Other plot points simply look different in the light of #MeToo. It is hard to imagine that Swift’s songs about her exes would be reviewed as sensationally today. I wonder if, in , any man would dare grab the microphone out of a young woman’s hands at an awards show. I stared into space for a good long while when I was reminded that Pitchfork did not review Taylor Swift’s  but did review Ryan Adams’s cover album of Taylor Swift’s . I ask Swift if she had always been aware of sexism. “I think about this a lot,” she says. “When I was a teenager, I would hear people talk about sexism in the music industry, and I’d be like, I don’t see it. I don’t understand. Then I realized that was because I was a kid. Men in the industry saw me as a kid. I was a lanky, scrawny, overexcited young girl who reminded them more of their little niece or their daughter than a successful woman in business or a colleague. The second I became a woman, in people’s perception, was when I started seeing it. “It’s fine to infantilize a girl’s success and say, How cute that she’s having some hit songs,” she goes on. “How cute that she’s writing songs. But the second it becomes formidable? As soon as I started playing stadiums—when I started to look like a woman—that wasn’t as cool anymore. It was when I started to have songs from Red come out and cross over, like ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ and ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.’ ” Those songs are also more assertive than the ones that came before, I say. “Yeah, the angle was different when I started saying, I knew you were trouble when you walked in. Basically, you emotionally manipulated me and I didn’t love it. That wasn’t fun for me.” I have to wonder if having her songwriting overlooked as her hits were picked apart and scrutinized wasn’t the biggest bummer of all. Swift: “I wanted to say to people, You realize writing songs is an art and a craft and not, like, an easy thing to do? Or to do well? People would act like it was a weapon I was using. Like a cheap dirty trick. Be careful, bro, she’ll write a song about you. Don’t stand near her. First of all, that’s not how it works. Second of all, find me a time when they say that about a male artist: Be careful, girl, he’ll use his experience with you to get—God forbid—inspiration to make art.” Without question the tenor of the Taylor Swift Narrative changed most dramatically in July , when Kim Kardashian West called her a “snake” on Twitter, and released video clips of Swift and Kanye West discussing the lyrics to his song “Famous.”  The posts sparked several hashtags, including #TaylorSwiftIsASnake and #TaylorSwiftIsCanceled, which quickly escalated into a months-long campaign to “cancel” Swift. To this day Swift doesn’t think people grasp the repercussions of that term. “A mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote canceled, is a very isolating experience,” she says. “I don’t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it’s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly.” She adds: “When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself.” An overhaul was in order. “I realized I needed to restructure my life because it felt completely out of control,” Swift says. “I knew immediately I needed to make music about it because I knew it was the only way I could survive it. It was the only way I could preserve my mental health and also tell the story of what it’s like to go through something so humiliating.” I get a sense of the whiplash Swift experienced when I notice that, a few months into this ordeal, while she was writing the songs that an interpolation of a ’s camp classic, Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy.”) Nonetheless, most critics read it as a grenade lobbed in the general direction of Calabasas. One longtime Nashville critic, Brian Mansfield, had a more plausible take: She was writing sarcastically as the “Taylor Swift” portrayed in the media in a bid for privacy. “Yeah, this is the character you created for me, let me just hide behind it,” she says now of the persona she created. “I always used this metaphor when I was younger. I’d say that with every reinvention, I never wanted to tear down my house. ’Cause I built this house. This house being, metaphorically, my body of work, my songwriting, my music, my catalog, my library. I just wanted to redecorate. I think a lot of people, with Reputation, would have perceived that I had torn down the house. Actually, I just built a bunker around it.” In March, the snakes started to morph into butterflies, the vampire color palette into Easter pastels. When a superbloom of wildflowers lured a mesmerizing deluge of Painted Lady butterflies to Los Angeles, Swift marked it with an Instagram post. She attended the iHeartRadio Music Awards that night in a sequin romper and stilettos with shimmery wings attached. Swift announced the single “ME!” a month later, with a large butterfly mural in Nashville. In the music video for the  bubblegum song, a hissing pastel-pink snake explodes into a kaleidoscope of butterflies. One flutters by the window of an apartment, where Swift is arguing in French with Urie. A record player is playing in the background. “It’s an old-timey, s-sounding instrumental version of ‘You Need to Calm Down,’ ’’ Swift says. Later, in the “Calm Down” video, Swift wears a  back tattoo of a snake swarmed by butterflies. We are only two songs in, people. Lover, to be released on August , will have a total of  songs. “I was compiling ideas for a very long time,” Swift says. “When I started writing, I couldn’t stop.”  Swift thinks Lover might be her favorite album yet. “There are so many ways in which this album feels like a new beginning,” she says. “This album is really a love letter to love, in all of its maddening, passionate, exciting, enchanting, horrific, tragic, wonderful glory.” I have to ask Swift, given how genuinely at peace she seems, if part of her isn’t thankful, if not for the Great Cancellation of , then for the person she now is—knowing who her friends are, knowing what’s what. “When you’re going through loss or embarrassment or shame, it’s a grieving process with so many micro emotions in a day. One of the reasons why I didn’t do interviews for Reputation was that I couldn’t figure out how I felt hour to hour. Sometimes I felt like: All these things taught me something that I never could have learned in a way that didn’t hurt as much. Five minutes later, I’d feel like: That was horrible. Why did that have to happen? What am I supposed to take from this other than mass amounts of humiliation? And then five minutes later I’d think: I think I might be happier than I’ve ever been.” She goes on: “It’s so strange trying to be self-aware when you’ve been cast as this always smiling, always happy ‘America’s sweetheart’ thing, and then having that taken away and realizing that it’s actually a great thing that it was taken away, because that’s extremely limiting.” Swift leans back in the cocoon and smiles: “We’re not going to go straight to gratitude with it. Ever. But we’re going to find positive aspects to it. We’re never going to write a thank-you note.” Though people will take the Perry-Swift burger-and-fries embrace in the “You Need to Calm Down” video as a press release that the two have mended fences, Swift says it’s actually a comment on how the media pits female pop stars against one another. After Perry sent Swift an  olive branch last year, Swift asked her to be in the video: “She wrote back, This makes me so emotional. I’m so up for this. I want us to be that example. But let’s spend some time together. Because I want it to be real. So she came over and we talked for hours. “We decided the metaphor for what happens in the media,” Swift explains, “is they pick two people and it’s like they’re pouring gasoline all over the floor. All that needs to happen is one false move, one false word, one misunderstanding, and a match is lit and dropped. That’s what happened with us. It was: Who’s better? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? The tension is so high that it becomes impossible for you to not think that the other person has something against you."" Meanwhile, the protesters in the video reference a real-life religious group that pickets outside Swift’s concerts, not the white working class in general, as some have assumed. “So many artists have them at their shows, and it’s such a confounding, confusing, infuriating thing to have outside of joyful concerts,” she tells me. “Obviously I don’t want to mention the actual entity, because they would get excited about that. Giving them press is not on my list of priorities.” At one point, Swift asks if I would like to hear two other songs off the new album.  First she plays “Lover,” the title track, coproduced by Jack Antonoff. “This has one of my favorite bridges,” she says. “I love a bridge, and I was really able to go to Bridge City.” It’s a romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget: classic Swift. “My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue,” she sings. “All’s well that ends well to end up with you.” Next, Swift cues up a track that “plays with the idea of perception.” She has often wondered how she would be written and spoken about if she were a man, “so I wrote a song called ‘The Man.’ ” It’s a thought experiment of sorts: “If I had made all the same choices, all the same mistakes, all the same accomplishments, how would it read?” Seconds later, Swift’s earpods are pumping a synth-pop earworm into my head: “I’d be a fearless leader. I’d be an alpha type. When everyone believes ya: What’s that like?” Swift wrote the first two singles with Joel Little, best known as one of Lorde’s go-to producers.  The album is likely to include more marquee names. A portrait of the Dixie Chicks in the background of the “ME!” video almost certainly portends a collaboration. If fans are correctly reading a button affixed to her denim jacket in a recent magazine cover, we can expect one with Drake, too. Speaking of: Inquiring fans will want to know if Swift dropped any more clues about how to decode Lover during this interview. For you I reviewed the audio again, and there were a few things that made my newly acquired Swifty sense tingle. At one point she compared superstardom in the digital age to life in a dollhouse, one where voyeurs “can ‘ship’ you with who they want to ‘ship’ you with, and they can ‘favorite’ friends that you have, and they can know where you are all the time.” The metaphor was precise and vivid and, well, a little too intricately rendered to be off the cuff.  Then there was the balloon—a giant gold balloon in the shape of a numeral seven that happened to float by while we were on her roof, on this, the occasion of her seventh album. “Is it an L’?” I say. “No, because look, the string is hanging from the bottom,” she says. It might seem an obvious symbolic gesture, deployed for this interview, except for how impossible that seems. Swift let me control the timing of nearly everything. Moreover, the gold seven wasn’t floating up from the sidewalk below. It was already high in the sky, drifting slowly toward us from down the street. She would have had to control the wind, or at least to have studied it. Would Taylor Swift really go to such elaborate lengths for her fans? This much I know: Yes, she would."

7mrTZBfk502J2SAi8rp8jm,"The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled transiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o'-the-wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer. THE CALLS Wait, my love, and I'll be with you. THE ANSWERS Round behind the stable. THE CHILDREN Kithoguel Salute. THE IDIOT  Grhahute! THE CHILDREN Where's the great light? THE IDIOT  Ghaghahest. CISSY CAFFREY I gave it to Molly Because she was jolly, The leg of the duck The leg of the duck. THE VIRAGO Signs on you, hairy arse. More power the Cavan girl. CISSY CAFFREY More luck to me. Cavan, Cootehill and Belturbet. I gave it to Nelly To stick in her belly The leg of the duck The leg of the duck. PRIVATE COMPTON  Way for the parson. PRIVATE CARR  What ho, parson! CISSY CAFFREY  She has it, she got it, Wherever she put it The leg of the duck. STEPHEN Vidi aquam egredientem de templo a latere dextro. Alleluia. THE BAWD  Sst! Come here till I tell you. Maidenhead inside. Sst. STEPHEN  Et omnes ad quos pervenit acqua ista. THE BAWD  Trinity medicals. Fallopian tube. All prick and no pence. EDY BOARDMAN  And say the one: I seen you up Faithful place with your squarepusher, the greaser off the railway, in his cometobed hat. Did you, says I. That's not for you to say, says I. You never seen me in the mantrap with a married highlander, says I. The likes of her! Stag that one is. Stubborn as a mule! And her walking with two fellows the one time, Kildbride the enginedriver and lancecorporal Oliphant. STEPHEN  Salvi facti i sunt. LYNCH So that? STEPHEN  So that gesture, not music, not odours, would be a universal language, the gift of tongues rendering visible not the lay sense but the first entelechy, the structural rhythm. LYNCH Pornosophical philotheology. Metaphysics in Mecklenburg street! STEPHEN We have shrewridden Shakespeare and henpecked Socrates. Even the allwisest stagyrite was bitted, bridled and mounted by a light of love. LYNCH Ba! STEPHEN Anyway, who wants two gestures to illustrate a loaf and a jug? This movement illustrates the loaf and jug of bread and wine in Omar. Hold my stick. LYNCH Damn your yellow stick. Where are we going? STEPHEN Lecherous lynx, to la belle dame sans merci, Georgina Johnson, ad deam qui laetificat juventutem meam. LYNCH Which is the jug of bread? It skills not. That or the customhouse. Illustrate thou. Here take your crutch and walk. (They pass. Tommy Caffrey scrambles to a gaslamp and, clasping, climbs in spasms. From the top spur he slides down. Jacky Caffrey clasps to climb. The navvy lurches against the lamp. The twins scuttle off in the dark. The navvy, swaying, presses a forefinger against a wing of his nose and ejects from the farther nostril a long liquid jet of snot. Shouldering the lamp he staggers away through the crowd with his flaring cresset. Snakes of river fog creep slowly. From drains, clefts, cesspools, middens arise on all sides stagnant fumes. A glow leaps in the south beyond the seaward reaches of the river. The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket. From Gillens hairdressers window a composite portrait shows him gallant Nelson's image. A concave mirror at the side presents to him lovelorn longlost lugubru Booloohoom. Grave Gladstone sees him level Bloom for Bloom. He passes, struck by the stare of truculent Wellington but in the con vex mirror grin unstruck the bonham eyes and fatchuck cheekchops of Jollypoldy the rixdix doldy. At Antonio Babaiotti's door Bloom halts, sweated under the bright arclamps. He disappears. In a moment he reappears and hurries on.) BLOOM Fish and taters. N. g. Ah! BLOOM Stitch in my side. Why did I run? BLOOM What is that? A flasher? Searchlight. BLOOM Aurora borealis or a steel foundry? Ah, the brigade, of course. South side anyhow. Big blaze. Might be his house. Beggar's bush. We're safe.  London's burning, London's burning! On fire, on fire!  I'll miss him. Run. Quick. Better cross here. THE URCHINS Mind out, mister!  THE BELLS Haltyaltyaltyall. BLOOM  Ow. THE GONG Bang Bang Bla Bak Blud Bugg Bloo. THE MOTORMAN Hey, shitbreeches, are you doing the hattrick? BLOOM  No thoroughfare. Close shave that but cured the stitch. Must take up Sandow's exercises again. On the hands down. Insure against street accident too. The Providential.  Poor mamma's panacea. Heel easily catch in tracks or bootlace in a cog. Day the wheel of the black Maria peeled off my shoe at Leonard's corner. Third time is the charm. Shoe trick. Insolent driver. I ought to report him. Tension makes them nervous. Might be the fellow balked me this morning with that horsey woman. Same style of beauty. Quick of him all the same. The stiff walk. True word spoken in jest. That awful cramp in Lad lane. Something poisonous I ate. Emblem of luck. Why? Probably lost cattle. Mark of the beast.  Bit light in the head. Monthly or effect of the other. Brainfogfag. That tired feeling. Too much for me now. Ow! BLOOM Buenos noches, señorita Blanca, que calle es esta? THE FIGURE  Password. Sraid Mabbot. BLOOM Haha. Merci. Esperanto. Slan leath.  Gaelic league spy, sent by that fireeater. BLOOM I beg.  BLOOM Keep to the right, right, right. If there is a fingerpost planted by the Touring Club at Stepaside who procured that public boon?

MRS BREEN Mr. BLOOM  Madam, when we last had this pleasure by letter dated the sixteenth instant . MRS BREEN Mr Bloom! You down here in the haunts of sin! I caught you nicely! Scamp! BLOOM  Not so loud my name. Whatever do you think me? Don't give me away. Walls have hears. How do you do? It's ages since I. You're looking splendid. Absolutely it. Seasonable weather we are having this time of year. Black refracts heat. Short cut home here. Interesting quarter. Rescue of fallen women Magdalen asylum. I am the secretary... MRS BREEN  Now don't tell a big fib! I know somebody won't like that. O just wait till I see Molly!  Account for yourself this very minute or woe betide you!

There's someone in the house with Dina There's someone in the house, I know, There's someone in the house with Dina Playing on the old banjo. BLOOM  A little frivol, shall we, if you are so inclined? Would you like me perhaps to embrace you just for a fraction of a second? MRS BREEN  O, you ruck! You ought to see yourself! BLOOM For old sake'sake. I only meant a square party, a mixed marriage mingling of our different little conjugials. You know I had a soft corner for you.  'Twas I sent you that valentine of the dear gazelle. MRS BREEN Glory Alice, you do look a holy show! Killing simply.  What are you hiding behind your back? Tell us, there's a dear. BLOOM  Josie Powell that was, prettiest deb in Dublin. How time flies by! Do you remember, harking back in a retrospective arrangement, Old Christmas night Georgina Simpson's housewarming while they were playing the Irving Bishop game, finding the pin blindfold and thoughtreading? Subject, what is in this snuff box? MRS BREEN You were the lion of the night with your seriocomic recitation and you looked the part. You were always a favourite with the ladies. BLOOM  Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Ireland, home and beauty. MRS BREEN The dear dead days beyond recall. Love's old sweet song. BLOOM  I confess I'm teapot with curiosity to find out whether some person's something is a little teapot at present. MRS BREEN  Tremendously teapot! London's tea pot and I'm simply teapot all over me.  After the parlour mystery games and the crackers from the tree we sat on the staircase ottoman. Under the mistletoe. Two is company. BLOOM  The witching hour of night. I took the splinter out of this hand, carefully, slowly.  Là ci darem la mano. MRS BREEN  Voglio e non. You're hot! You're scalding! The left hand nearest the heart. BLOOM When you made your present choice they said it was beauty and the beast. I can never forgive you for that.  Think what it means. All you meant to me then.  Woman, it's breaking me!  ALF BERGAN  U.p.: Up. MRS BREEN  High jinks below stairs.  Why didn't you kiss the spot to make it well? You wanted to. BLOOM  Molly's best friend! Could you? MRS BREEN  Hnhn. The answer is a lemon. Have you a little present for me there? BLOOM  Kosher. A snack for supper. The home without potted meat is incomplete. I was at Leah. Mrs Bandman Palmer.

I am in a grave predicament. MRS BREEN Humbugging and delutbering as per usual with your cock and bull story. BLOOM I want to tell you a little secret about how I came to be here. But you must never tell. Not even Molly. I have a most particular reason. MRS BREEN  O, not for worlds. BLOOM Let's walk on. Shall us? MRS BREEN Let's. THE BAWD Jewman's melt! BLOOM  Do you remember a long long time, years and years ago, just after Milly, Marionette we called her, was weaned when we all went together to Fairyhouse races, was it? MRS BREEN  Leopardstown. BLOOM I mean, Leopardstown. And Molly won seven shillings on a three year old named Nevertell and coming home along by Foxrock in that old fiveseater shanderadan of a waggonette you were in your heyday then and you had on that new hat of white velours with a surround of molefur that Mrs Hayes advised you to buy because it was marked down to nineteen and eleven, a bit of wire and an old rag of velveteen, and I'll lay you what you like she did it on purpose... MRS BREEN She did, of course, the cat! Don't tell me! Nice adviser! BLOOM Because it didn't suit you one quarter as well as the other ducky little tammy toque with the bird of paradise wing in it that I admired on you and you honestly looked just too fetching in it though it was a pity to kill it, you cruel creature, little mite of a thing with a heart the size of a fullstop. MRS BREEN  Naughty cruel I was. BLOOM  And Molly was eating a sandwich of spiced beef out of Mrs Joe Gallaher's lunch basket. Frankly, though she had her advisers or admirers, I never cared much for her style. She was . MRS BREEN Too. BLOOM Yes. And Molly was laughing because Rogers and Maggot O'Reilly were mimicking a cock as we passed a farmhouse and Marcus Tertius Moses, the tea merchant, drove past us in a gig with his daughter, Dancer Moses was her name, and the poodle in her lap bridled up and you asked me if I ever heard or read or knew or came across . MRS BREEN  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. THE GAFFER  And when Cairns came down from the scaffolding in Beaver Street what was he after doing it into only into the bucket of porter that was there waiting on the shavings for Derwan's plasterers. THE LOITERERS  O jays! BLOOM Coincidence too. They think it funny. Anything but that. Broad daylight. Trying to walk. Lucky no woman. THE LOITERERS Jays, that's a good one. Glauber salts. O jays, into the men's porter. THE WHORES Are you going far, queer fellow? How's your middle leg? Got a match on you? Eh, come here till I stiffen it for you. THE NAVVY  Where's the bloody house?

I scolded that tramdriver on Harold's cross bridge for illusing the poor horse with his harness scab. Bad French I got for my pains. Of course it was frosty and the last tram. All tales of circus life are highly demoralising. SIGNOR MAFFEI  Ladies and gentlemen, my educated greyhound. It was I broke in the bucking broncho Ajax with my patent spiked saddle for carnivores. Lash under the belly with a knotted thong. Block tackle and a strangling pully will bring your lion to heel, no matter how fractious, even Leo ferox there, the Libyan maneater. A redhot crowbar and some liniment rubbing on the burning part produced Fritz of Amsterdam, the thinking hyena.  I possess the Indian sign. The glint of my eye does it with these breastsparklers.  I now introduce Mademoiselle Ruby, the pride of the ring. FIRST WATCH Come. Name and address. BLOOM I have forgotten for the moment. Ah, yes!  Dr Bloom, Leopold, dental surgeon. You have heard of von Bloom Pasha. Umpteen mil lions. Donnerwetter! Owns half Austria. Egypt. Cousin. FIRST WATCH Proof. BLOOM  Allow me. My club is the Junior Army and Navy. Solicitors: Messrs John Henry Menton,  Bachelor's Walk. FIRST WATCH  Henry Flower. No fixed abode. Un lawfully watching and besetting. SECOND WATCH An alibi. You are cautioned. BLOOM  This is the flower in question. It was given me by a man I don't know his name.  You know that old joke, rose of Castille. Bloom. The change of name Virag.  We are engaged you see, sergeant. Lady in the case. Love entanglement.  Dash it all. It's a way we gallants have in the navy. Uniform that does it.  Still, of course, you do get your Waterloo sometimes. Drop in some evening and have a glass of old Burgundy.  I'll introduce you, inspector. She's game. Do it in shake of a lamb's tail. THE DARK MERCURY The Castle is looking for him.

Mistaken identity. The Lyons mail. Lesurques and Dubosc. You remember the Childs fratricide case. We medical men. By striking him dead with a hatchet. I am wrongfully accused. Better one guilty escape than ninetynine wrongfully condemned. MARTHA  Breach of promise. My real name is Peggy Griffin. He wrote to me that he was miserable. I'll tell my brother, the Bective rugger fullback, on you, heartless flirt. BLOOM  She's drunk. The woman is inebriated.  Shitbroleeth. SECOND WATCH  You ought to be thoroughly well ashamed of yourself. BLOOM Gentleman of the jury, let me explain. A pure mare's nest. I am a man misunderstood. I am being made a scapegoat of. I am a respectable married man, without a stain on my character. I live in Eccles street. My wife, I am the daughter of a most distinguished commander, a gallant upstanding gentleman, who do you call him, Majorgeneral Brian Tweedy, one of Britain's fighting men who helped to win our battles. Got his majority for the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift. FIRST WATCH Regiment. BLOOM  The royal Dublins, boys, the salt of the earth, known the world over. I think I see some old comrades in arms up there among you. The R. D. F. With our own Metropolitan police, guardians of our homes, the pluckiest lads and the finest body of men, as physique, in the service of our sovereign. A VOICE Turncoat! Up the Boers! Who booed Joe Chamberlain? BLOOM  My old dad too was a J.P. I'm as staunch a Britisher as you are, sir. I fought with the colours for king and country in the absentminded war under General Gough in the park and was disabled at Spion Kop and Bloemfontein, was mentioned in dispatches. I did all a white man could.  Jim Bludso. Hold her nozzle again the bank. FIRST WATCH Profession or trade. BLOOM Well, I follow a literary occupation. Author-journalist. In fact we are just bringing out a collection of prize stories of which I am the inventor, something that is an entirely new departure. I am connected with the British and Irish press. If you ring up... MYLES CRAWFORD  Hello, seventyseven eightfour. Hello. Freeman's Urinal and Weekly Arse wiper here. Paralyse Europe. You which? Bluebags? Who writes? Is it Bloom? BEAUFOY  No, you aren't, not by a long shot if I know it. I don't see it, that's all. No born gentleman, no one with the most rudimentary promptings of a gentleman would stoop to such particularly loathsome conduct. One of those, my lord. A plagiarist. A soapy sneak masquerading as a literateur. It's perfectly obvious that with the most inherent baseness he has cribbed some of my bestselling books, really gorgeous stuff, a perfect gem, the love passages in which are beneath suspicion. The Beaufoy books of love and great possessions with which your lordship is doubtless familiar, are a household word throughout the kingdom. BLOOM  That bit about the laughing witch hand in hand I take exception to, if I may... ? BEAUFOY  You funny ass, you! You're too beastly awfully weird for words! I don't think you need over excessively disincommodate yourself in that regard. My literary agent Mr J. B. Pinker is in attendance. I presume, my lord, we shall receive the usual witnesses' fees, shan't we? We are considerably out of pocket over this bally pressman johnny, this jackdaw of Rheims, who has not even been to a university. BLOOM  University of life. Bad art. BEAUFOY  It's a damnably foul lie showing the moral rottenness of the man!  We have here damning evidence, the corpus delicti, my lord, a specimen of my maturer work disfigured by the hallmark of the beast. A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY Moses, Moses, king of the jews, Wiped his arse in the Daily News. BLOOM  Overdrawn. BEAUFOY You low cad! You ought to be ducked in the horsepond, you rotter!  Why, look at the man's private life! Leading a quadruple existence! Street angel and house devil. Not fit to be mentioned in mixed society. The arch conspirator of the age. BLOOM  And he, a bachelor, how. FIRST WATCH The King versus Bloom. Call the woman Driscoll. THE CRIER Mary Driscoll, scullerymaid! SECOND WATCH Another! Are you of the unfortunate class? MARY DRISCOLL  I'm not a bad one. I bear a respectable character and was four months in my last place. I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out, and I had to leave owing to his carryings on. FIRST WATCH What do you tax him with? MARY DRISCOLL He made a certain suggestion but I thought more of myself as poor as I am. BLOOM  I treated you white. I gave you mementoes, smart emerald garters far above your station. Incautiously I took your part when you were accused of pilfering. There's a medium in all things. Play cricket. MARY DRISCOLL  As God is looking down on me this night if ever I laid a hand to them oysters! FIRST WATCH The offence complained of? Did something happen? MARY DRISCOLL He surprised me in the rere of the premises, your honour, when the missus was out shopping one morning with a request for a safety pin. He held me and I was discoloured in four places as a result. And he interfered twice with my clothing. BLOOM She counterassaulted. MARY DRISCOLL  I had more respect for the scouringbrush, so I had. I remonstrated with him, your lord, and he remarked: Keep it quiet! GEORGES FOTTRELL  Order in court! The accused will now make a bogus statement. LONGHAND AND SHORTHAND  Loosen his boots. PROFESSOR MACHUGH  Cough it up, man. Get it out in bits. J. J. O'MOLLOY  This is no place for indecent levity at the expense of an erring mortal disguised in liquor. We are not in a beargarden nor at an Oxford rag nor is this a travesty of justice. My client is an infant, a poor foreign immigrant who started scratch as a stowaway and is now trying to turn an honest penny. The trumped up misdemeanour was due to a momentary aberration of heredity, brought on by hallucination, such familiarities as the alleged guilty occurrence being quite permitted in my client's native place, the land of the Pharaoh. Prima facie, I put it to you that there was no attempt at carnally knowing. Intimacy did not occur and the offence complained of by Driscoll, that her virtue was solicited, was not repeated. I would deal inespecial with atavism. There have been cases of shipwreck and somnambulism in my client's family. If the accused could speak he could a tale unfold one of the strangest that have ever been narrated between the covers of a book. He himself, my lord, is a physical wreck from cobbler's weak chest. His submission is that he is of Mongolian extraction and irresponsible for his actions. Not all there, in fact. BLOOM  Him makee velly muchee fine night.  Li li poo lil chile, Blingee pigfoot evly night. Payee two shilly... J. J. O'MOLLOY  This is a lonehand fight. By Hades, I will not have any client of mine gagged and badgered in this fashion by a pack of curs and laughing hyenas. The Mosaic code has superseded the law of the jungle. I say it and I say it emphatically without wishing for one moment to defeat the ends of justice, accused was not accessory before the act and prosecutrix has not been tampered with. The young person was treated by defendant as if she were his very own daughter.  I shall call rebutting evidence to prove up to the hilt that the hidden hand is again at its old game. When in doubt persecute Bloom. My client, an innately bashful man, would be the last man in the world to do anything ungentlemanly which injured modesty could object to or cast a stone at a girl who took the wrong turning when some dastard, responsible for her condition, had worked his own sweet will on her. He wants to go straight. I regard him as the whitest man I know. He is down on his luck at present owing to the mortgaging of his extensive property at Agendath Netaim in faraway Asia Minor, slides of which will now be shown.  I suggest that you will do the handsome thing. BLOOM A penny in the pound. DLUGACZ  Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W. . J. J. O'MOLLOY  Excuse me, I am suffering from a severe chill, have recently come from a sickbed. A few wellchosen words.  When the angel's book comes to be opened if aught that the pensive bosom has inaugurated of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live I say accord the prisoner at the bar the sacred benefit of the doubt.  BLOOM  Can give best references. Messrs Callan, Coleman. Mr Wisdom Hely J. P. My old chief Joe Cuffe. Mr V. B. Dillon, ex-lord mayor of Dublin. I have moved in the charmed circle of the highest . Queens of Dublin Society.  I was just chatting this afternoon at the viceregal lodge to my old pals, sir Robert and lady Ball, astronomer royal, at the levee. Sir Bob, I said... MRS YELVERTON BARRY  Arrest him constable. He wrote me an anonymous letter in prentice backhand when my husband was in the North Riding of Tipperary on the Munster circuit, signed James Lovebirch. He said that he had seen from the gods my peerless globes as I sat in a box of the Theatre Royal at a command performance of La Cigale. I deeply inflamed him, he said. He made improper overtures to me to misconduct myself at half past four p.m. on the following Thursday, Dunsink time. He offered to send me through the post a work of fiction by Monsieur Paul de Kock, entitled The Girl with the Three Pairs of Stays. MRS BELLINGHAM  Also to me. Yes, I believe it is the same objectionable person. Because he closed my carriage door outside sir Thornley Stoker's one sleety day during the cold snap of February ninetythree when even the grid of the wastepipe and ballstop in my bath cistern were frozen. Subsequently he enclosed a bloom of edelweiss culled on the heights, as he said, in my honour. I had it examined by a botanical expert and elicited the information that it was a blossom of the homegrown potato plant purloined from a forcingcase of the model farm. MRS YELVERTON BARRY Shame on him! THE SLUTS AND RAGAMUFFINS  Stop thief! Hurrah there, Bluebeard! Three cheers for Ikey Mo! SECOND WATCH  Here are the darbies. MRS BELLINGHAM He addressed me in several handwritings with fulsome compliments as a Venus in furs and alleged profound pity for my frostbound coachman Balmer while in the same breath he expressed himself as envious of his earflaps and fleecy sheepskins and of his fortunate proximity to my person, when standing behind my chair wearing my livery and the armorial bearings of the Bellingham escutcheon garnished sable, a buck's head couped or. He lauded almost extravagantly my nether extremities, my swelling calves in silk hose drawn up to the limit, and eulogised glowingly my other hidden treasures in priceless lace which, he said, he could conjure up. He urged me, stating that he felt it his mission in life to urge me, to defile the marriage bed, to commit adultery at the earliest possible opportunity. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS  Also me. Because he saw me on the polo ground of the Phoenix park at the match All Ireland versus the Rest of Ireland. My eyes, I know, shone divinely as I watched Captain Slogger Dennehy of the Inniskillings win the final chukkar on his darling cob Centaur. This plebeian Don Juan observed me from behind a hackney car and sent me in double envelopes an obscene photograph, such as are sold after dark on Paris boulevards, insulting to any lady. I have it still. It represents a partially nude senorita, frail and lovely , practising illicit intercourse with a muscular torero, evidently a blackguard. He urged me to do likewise, to misbehave, to sin with officers of the garrison. He implored me to soil his letter in an unspeakable manner, to chastise him as he richly deserves, to bestride and ride him, to give him a most vicious horsewhipping. MRS BELLINGHAM Me too. MRS YELVERTON BARRY Me too. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS  I will, by the God above me. I'll scourge the pigeonlivered cur as long as I can stand over him. I'll flay him alive. BLOOM  Here?  Again!  I love the danger. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS Very much so! I'll make it hot for you. I'll make you dance Jack Latten for that. MRS BELLINGHAM Tan his breech well, the upstart! Write the stars and stripes on it! MRS YELVERTON BARRY Disgraceful! There's no excuse for him! A married man! BLOOM All these people. I meant only the spanking idea. A warm tingling glow without effusion. Refined birching to stimulate the circulation. THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS  O, did you, my fine fellow? Well, by the living God, you'll get the surprise of your life now, believe me, the most unmerciful hiding a man ever bargained for. You have lashed the dormant tigress in my nature into fury. MRS BELLINGHAM  Make him smart, Hanna dear. Give him ginger. Thrash the mongrel within an inch of his life. The cat-o' nine-tails. Geld him. Vivisect him. BLOOM  O cold! O shivery! It was your ambrosial beauty. Forget, forgive. Kismet. Let me off this once.  MRS YELVERTON BARRY  Don't do so on any account, Mrs Talboys! He should be soundly trounced! THE HONOURABLE MRS MERVYN TALBOYS  I'll do no such thing. Pig dog and always was ever since he was pupped! To dare address me! I'll flog him black and blue in the public streets. I'll dig my spurs in him up to the rowel. He is a wellknown cuckold.  Take down his trousers without loss of time. Come here, sir! Quick! Ready? BLOOM  The weather has been so warm.

DOWIE  Fellowchristians and antiBloomites, the man called Bloom is from the roots of hell, a disgrace to christian men. A fiendish libertine from his earliest years this stinking goat of Mendes gave precocious signs of infantile debauchery recalling the cities of the plain, with a dissolute granddam. This vile hypocrite, bronzed with infamy, is the white bull mentioned in the Apocalypse. A worshipper of the Scarlet Woman, intrigue is the very breath of his nostrils. The stake faggots and the caldron of boiling oil are for him. Caliban! THE MOB Lynch him! Roast him! He's as bad as Parnell was. Mr Fox! BLOOM  This is midsummer madness, some ghastly joke again. By heaven, I am guiltless as the unsunned snow! It was my brother Henry. He is my double. He lives in number  Dolphin's Barn. Slander, the viper, has wrongfully accused me. Fellowcountrymen, sgenl inn ban bata coisde gan capall. I call on my old friend, Dr Malachi Mulligan, sex specialist to give medical testimony on my behalf. DR MULLIGAN  Dr Bloom is bisexually abnormal. He has recently escaped from Dr Eustace's private asylum for demented gentlemen. Born out of bedlock hereditary epilepsy is present, the consequence of unbridled lust. Traces of elephantiasis have been discovered among his ascendants. There are marked symptoms of chronic exhibitionism. Ambidexterity is also latent. He is prematurely bald from selfabuse, perversely idealistic in consequence, a reformed rake, and has metal teeth. In consequence of a family complex he has temporarily lost his memory and I believe him to be more sinned against than sinning. I have made a pervaginal examination and, after application of the acid test to  anal, axillary, pectoral and pubic hairs, I declare him to be virgo intacta. DR MADDEN Hypsospadia is also marked. In the interest of coming generations I suggest that the parts affected should be preserved in spirits of wine in the national teratological museum. DR CROTTHERS I have examined the patient's urine. It is albuminoid. Salivation is insufficient, the patellar reflex intermittent. DR PUNCH COSTELLO The fetor judaicus is most perceptible. DR DIXON  Professor Bloom is a finished example of the new womanly man. His moral nature is simple and lovable. Many have found him a dear man, a dear person. He is a rather quaint fellow on the whole, coy though not feeble-minded in the medical sense. He has written a really beautiful letter, a poem in itself, to the court missionary of the Reformed Priests' Protection Society which clears up everything. He is practically a total abstainer and I can affirm that he sleeps on a straw litter and eats the most Spartan food, cold dried grocer's peas. He wears a hairshirt winter and summer and scourges himself every Saturday. He was, I understand, at one time a firstclass misdemeanant in Glencree reformatory. Another report states that he was a very posthumous child. I appeal for clemency in the name of the most sacred word our vocal organs have ever been called upon to speak. He is about to have a baby. BLOOM O, I so want to be a mother. MRS THORNTON  Embrace me tight, dear. You'll be soon over it. Tight, dear. A VOICE Bloom, are you the Messiah ben Joseph or ben David? BLOOM  You have said it.

Such fleshy parts are the product of careful nurture. When coopfattened their livers reach an elephantine size.

Woman, undoing with sweet pudor her belt of rushrope, offers her allmoist yoni to man's lingam. Short time after man presents woman with pieces of jungle meat. Woman shows joy and covers herself with featherskins. Man loves her yoni fiercely with big lingam, the stiff one.  Coactus volui. Then giddy woman will run about. Strong man grasps woman's wrist.

BLOOM Yes. No. THE FAN  Is me her was you dreamed before? Was then she him you us since knew? Am all them and the same now we?  BLOOM  Powerful being. In my eyes read that slumber which women love. THE FAN  We have met. You are mine. It is fate. BLOOM  Exuberant female. Enormously I desiderate your domination. I am exhausted, abandoned, no more young. I stand, so to speak, with an unposted letter bearing the extra regulation fee before the too late box of the general postoffice of human life. The door and window open at a right angle cause a draught of thirtytwo feet per second according to the law of falling bodies. I have felt this instant a twinge of sciatica in my left glutear muscle. It runs in our family. Poor dear papa, a widower, was a regular barometer from it. He believed in animal heat. A skin of tabby lined his winter waistcoat. Near the end, remembering king David and the Sunamite, he shared his bed with Athos, faithful after death. A dog's spittle, as you probably...  Ah! RICHIE GOULDING  Mocking is catch. Best value in Dub. Fit for a prince's liver and kidney. THE FAN  All things end. Be mine. Now. BLOOM  All now? I should not have parted with my talisman. Rain, exposure at dewfall on the sea rocks, a peccadillo at my time of life. Every phenomenon has a natural cause. THE FAN  You may. BLOOM  We are observed. THE FAN  You must. BLOOM  I can make a true black knot. Learned when I served my time and worked the mail order line for Kellet's. Experienced hand. Every knot says a lot. Let me. In courtesy. I knelt once before today. Ah! BLOOM  To be a shoefitter in Mansfield's was my love's young dream, the darling joys of sweet buttonhooking, to lace up crisscrossed to kneelength the dressy kid footwear satinlined, so incredibly small, of Clyde Road ladies. Even their wax model Raymonde I visited daily to admire her cobweb hose and stick of rhubarb toe, as worn in Paris. THE HOOF Smell my hot goathide. Feel my royal weight. BLOOM  Too tight? THE HOOF If you bungle, Handy Andy, I'll kick your football for you. BLOOM Not to lace the wrong eyelet as I did the night of the bazaar dance. Bad luck. Nook in wrong tache of her... person you mentioned. That night she met... Now! BLOOM  Awaiting your further orders, we remain, gentlemen. BELLO  Hound of dishonour! BLOOM  Empress!

BLOOM  I promise never to disobey. BELLO  Holy smoke! You little know what's in store for you. I'm the tartar to settle your little lot and break you in! I'll bet Kentucky cocktails all round I shame it out of you, old son. Cheek me, I dare you. If you do tremble in anticipation of heel discipline to be inflicted in gym costume. (Bloom creeps under the sofa and peers out through the fringe. ZOE  She's not here. BLOOM  She's not here. FLORRY  She didn't mean it, Mr Bello. She'll be good, sir. KITTY Don't be too hard on her, Mr Bello. Sure you won't, ma'amsir. BELLO  Come, ducky dear. I want a word with you, darling, just to administer correction. Just a little heart to heart talk, sweety.  There's a good girly now.  I only want to correct you for your own good on a soft safe spot. How's that tender behind? O, ever so gently, pet. Begin to get ready. BLOOM  Don't tear my. BELLO  The nosering, the pliers, the bastinado, the hanging hook, the knout I'll make you kiss while the flutes play like the Nubian slave of old. You're in for it this time. I'll make you remember me for the balance of your natural life.  I shall sit on your ottoman saddleback every morning after my thumping good breakfast of Matterson's fat ham rashers and a bottle of Guinness's porter.  And suck my thumping good Stock Exchange cigar while I read the Licensed Victualler's Gazette. Very possibly I shall have you slaughtered and skewered in my stables and enjoy a slice Of you with crisp crackling from the baking tin basted and baked like sucking pig with rice and lemon or currant sauce. It will hurt you. BLOOM Don't be cruel, nurse! Don't! BELLO  Another! BLOOM  O, it's hell itself! Every nerve in my body aches like mad! BELLO  Good, by the rumping jumping general! That's the best bit of news I heard these six weeks. Here, don't keep me waiting, damn you.  BLOOM  You're after hitting me. I'll tell... BELLO Hold him down, girls, till I squat on him. ZOE Yes. Walk on him! I will. FLORRY I will. Don't be greedy. KITTY No, me. Lend him to me. MRS KEOCH  Can I help?  BELLO  I see Keating Clay is elected chairman of the Richmond Asylum and bytheby Guinness's preference shares are at sixteen three quarters. Curse me for a fool that I didn't buy that lot Craig and Gardner told me about. Just my infernal luck, curse it. And that Goddamned outsider Throwaway at twenty to one.  Where's that Goddamned cursed ashtray? BLOOM  O! O! Monsters! Cruel one! BELLO Ask for that every ten minutes. Beg, pray for it as you never prayed before.  Here, kiss that. Both. Kiss.  Gee up! A cockhorse to Banbury cross. I'll ride him for the Eclipse stakes.  Ho! off we pop! I'll nurse you in proper fashion.  The lady goes a pace a pace and the coachman goes a trot a trot and the gentleman goes a gallop a gallop a gallop a gallop. FLORRY  Let me on him now. You had enough. I asked before you. ZOE  Me. Me. Are you not finished with him yet, suckeress? BLOOM  Can't. BELLO Well, I'm not. Wait.  Curse it. Here. This bung's about burst.  Take that!  Yes, by Jingo, sixteen three quarters. BLOOM  Not man.  Woman. BELLO  No more blow hot and cold. What you longed for has come to pass. Henceforth you are unmanned and mine in earnest, a thing under the yoke. Now for your punishment frock. You will shed your male garments, you understand, Ruby Cohen? and don the shot silk luxuriously rustling over head and shoulders and quickly too. BLOOM  Silk, mistress said! O crinkly! scrapy! Must I tip-touch it with my nails? BELLO  As they are now, so will you be, wigged, singed, perfumesprayed, ricepowdered, with smoothshaven armpits. Tape measurements will be taken next your skin. You will be laced with cruel force into vicelike corsets of soft dove coutille, with whalebone busk, to the diamond trimmed pelvis, the absolute outside edge, while your figure, plumper than when at large, will be restrained in nettight frocks, pretty two ounce petticoats and fringes and things stamped, of course, with my houseflag, creations of lovely lingerie for Alice and nice scent for Alice. Alice will feel the pullpull. Martha and Mary will be a little chilly at first in such delicate thighcasing but the frilly flimsiness of lace round your bare knees will remind you... BLOOM  I tried her things on only once, a small prank, in Holles street. When we were hardup I washed them to save the laundry bill. My own shirts I turned. It was the purest thrift. BELLO  Little jobs that make mother pleased, eh! and showed off coquettishly in your domino at the mirror behind close-drawn blinds your unskirted thighs and hegoat's udders, in various poses of surrender, eh? Ho! Ho! I have to laugh! That secondhand black operatop shift and short trunk leg naughties all split up the stitches at her last rape that Mrs Miriam Dandrade sold you from the Shelbourne Hotel, eh? BLOOM Miriam, Black. Demimondaine. BELLO  Christ Almighty, it's too tickling, this! You were a nicelooking Miriam when you clipped off your backgate hairs and lay swooning in the thing across the bed as Mrs Dandrade, about to be violated by Lieutenant Smythe Smythe, Mr Philip Augustus Blockwell, M.P., Signor Laci Daremo, the robust tenor, blueeyed Bert, the liftboy, Henry Fleury of Gordon Bennett fame, Sheridan, the quadroon Cr&Aelig;sus, the varsity wetbob eight from old Trinity, Ponto, her splendid Newfoundland and Bobs, dowager duchess of Manorhamilton.  Christ, wouldn't it make a Siamese cat laugh? BLOOM  It was Gerald converted me to be a true corsetlover when I was female impersonator in the High School play Vice Versa. It was dear Gerald. He got that kink, fascinated by sister's stays. Now dearest Gerald uses pinky greasepaint and gilds his eyelids. Cult of the beautiful. BELLO  Beautiful! Give us a breather! When you took your seat with womanish care, lifting your billowy flounces, on the smoothworn throne. BLOOM Science. To compare the various joys we each enjoy.  And really it's better the position... because often I used to wet. BELLO  No insubordination. The sawdust is there in the corner for you. I gave you strict instructions, didn't I? Do it standing, sir! I'll teach you to behave like a jinkleman! If I catch a trace on your swaddles. Aha! By the ass of the Dorans you'll find I'm a martinet. The sins of your past are rising against you. Many. Hundreds. THE SINS OF THE PAST  He went through a form of clandestine marriage with at least one woman in the shadow of the Black Church. Unspeakable messages he telephoned mentally to Miss Dunn at an address in d'Olier Street while he presented himself indecently to the instrument in the callbox. By word and deed he encouraged a nocturnal strumpet to deposit fecal and other matter in an unsanitary outhouse attached to empty premises. In five public conveniences he wrote pencilled messages offering his nuptial partner to all strongmembered males. And by the offensively smelling vitriol works did he not pass night after night by loving courting couples to see if and what and how much he could see? Did he not lie in bed, the gross boar, gloating over a nauseous fragment of wellused toilet paper presented to him by a nasty harlot, stimulated by gingerbread and a postal order? BELLO  Say! What was the most revolting piece of obscenity in all your career of crime? Go the whole hog. Puke it out. Be candid for once. BLOOM Don't ask me. Our mutual faith. Pleasants street. I only thought the half of the... I swear on my sacred oath... BELLO  Answer. Repugnant wretch! I insist on knowing. Tell me something to amuse me, smut or a bloody good-ghoststory or a line of poetry, quick, quick, quick! Where? How? What time? With how many? I give you just three seconds. One! Two! Thr... ! BLOOM  I rererepugnosed in rerererepugnant... BELLO  O get out, you skunk! Hold your tongue! Speak when you're spoken to. BLOOM  Master! Mistress! Mantamer! BELLO  By day you will souse and bat our smelling underclothes, also when we ladies are unwell, and swab out our latrines with dress pinned up and a dishclout tied to your tail. Won't that be nice?  And there now! With this ring I thee own. Say, thank you, mistress. BLOOM Thank you, mistress. BELLO You will make the beds, get my tub ready, empty the pisspots in the different rooms, including old Mrs Keogh's the cook's, a sandy one. Ay, and rinse the seven of them well, mind, or lap it up like champagne. Drink me piping hot. Hop! you will dance attendance or I'll lecture you on your misdeeds, Miss Ruby, and spank your bare bot right well, miss, with the hairbrush. You'll be taught the error of your ways. At night your wellcreamed braceleted hands will wear fortythreebutton gloves newpowdered with talc and having delicately scented fingertips. For such favours knights of old laid down their lives.  My boys will be no end charmed to see you so ladylike, the colonel, above all. When they come here the night before the wedding to fondle my new attraction in gilded heels. First, I'll have a go at you myself. A man I know on the turf named Charles Alberta Marsh  is on the lookout for a maid of all work at a short knock. Swell the bust. Smile. Droop shoulders. What offers?  For that lot trained by owner to fetch and carry, basket in mouth.  There's fine depth for you! What, boys? That give you a hardon?  Here, wet the deck and wipe it round! A BIDDER A florin! A VOICE One and eightpence too much. THE LACQUEY Barang! CHARLES ALBERTA MARSH Must be virgin. Good breath. Clean. BELLO  Two bar. Rockbottom figure and cheap at the price. Fourteen hands high. Touch and examine his points. Handle him. This downy skin, these soft muscles, this tender flesh. If I had only my gold piercer here! And quite easy to milk. Three newlaid gallons a day. A pure stock getter, due to lay within the hour. His sire's milk record was a thousand gallons of whole milk in forty weeks. Whoa, my jewel! Beg up! Whoa!  So! Warranted Cohen! What advance on two bob, gentlemen? A DARKVISAGED MAN  Hoondert punt sterlink. VOICES  For the Caliph Haroun Al Raschid. BELLO  Right. Let them all come. The scanty, daringly short skirt, riding up at the knee to show a peep of white pantalette, is a potent weapon and transparent stockings, emeraldgartered, with the long straight seam trailing up beyond the knee, appeal to the better instincts of the blasé man about town. Learn the smooth mincing walk on four inch Louis XV heels, the Grecian bend with provoking croup, the thighs fluescent, knees modestly kissing. Bring all your power of fascination to bear on them. Pander to their Gomorrahan vices. BLOOM  O, I know what you're hinting at now. BELLO What else are you good for, an impotent thing like you?  Up! Up! Manx cat! What have we here? Where's your curly teapot gone to or who docked it on you, cockyolly? Sing, birdy, sing. It's as limp as a boy of six's doing his pooly behind a cart. Buy a bucket or sell your pump.  Can you do a man's job? BLOOM Eccles Street. BELLO  I wouldn't hurt your feelings for the world but there's a man of brawn in possession there. The tables are turned, my gay young fellow! He is something like a fullgrown outdoor man. Well for you, you muff, if you had that weapon with knobs and lumps and warts all over it. He shot his bolt, I can tell you! Foot to foot, knee to knee, belly to belly, bubs to breast! He's no eunuch. A shock of red hair he has sticking out of him behind like a furzebush! Wait for nine months, my lad! Holy ginger, it's kicking and coughing up and down in her guts already! That makes you wild, don't it? Touches the spot?  Spittoon! BLOOM I was indecently treated, I... inform the police. Hundred pounds. Unmentionable. I. BELLO Would if you could, lame duck. A downpour we want, not your drizzle. BLOOM To drive me mad! Moll! I forgot! Forgive! Moll!... We... Still... BELLO  No, Leopold Bloom, all is changed by woman's will since you slept horizontal in Sleepy Hollow your night of twenty years. Return and see. SLEEPY HOLLOW Rip Van Winkle! Rip Van Winkle! BLOOM  I see her! It's she! The first night at Mat Dillon's! But that dress, the green! And her hair is dyed gold and he. BELLO  That's your daughter, you owl, with a Mullingar student. MILLY My! It's Papli! But. O Papli, how old you've grown! BELLO Changed, eh? Our whatnot, our writing table where we never wrote, Aunt Hegarty's armchair, our classic reprints of old masters. A man and his men friends are living there in clover. The Cuckoos' Rest! Why not? How many women had you, say? Following them up dark streets, flatfoot, exciting them by your smothered grunts. What, you male prostitute? Blameless dames with parcels of groceries. Turn about. Sauce for the goose, my gander, O. BLOOM They... I BELLO  Their heelmarks will stamp the Brusselette carpet you bought at Wren's auction. In their horseplay with Moll the romp to find the buck flea in her breeches they will deface the little statue you carried home in the rain for art for art's sake. They will violate the secrets of your bottom drawer. Pages will be torn from your handbook of astronomy to make them pipespills. And they will spit in your ten shilling brass fender from Hampton Leedom's. BLOOM Ten and six. The act of low scoundrels. Let me go. I will return. I will prove... A VOICE Swear! BELLO As a paying guest or a kept man? Too late. You have made your secondbest bed and others must lie in it. Your epitaph is written. You are down and out and don't you forget it, old bean. BLOOM Justice! All Ireland versus one! Has nobody... ? BELLO Die and be damned to you if you have any sense of decency or grace about you. I can give you a rare old wine that'll send you skipping to hell and back. Sign a will and leave us any coin you have. If you have none see you damn well get it, steal it, rob it! We'll bury you in our shrubbery jakes where you'll be dead and dirty with old Cuck Cohen, my stepnephew I married, the bloody old gouty procurator and sodomite with a crick in his neck, and my other ten or eleven husbands, what ever the buggers' names were, suffocated in the one cess pool.  We'll manure you, Mr Flower!  Byby, Poldy! Byby, Papli! BLOOM  My will power! Memory! I have sinned! I have suff...  BELLO  Crybabby! Crocodile tears!

THE YEWS  Sister. Our sister. Ssh. THE NYMPH  Mortal!  Nay, dost not weepest! BLOOM  This position. I felt it was expected of me. Force of habit. THE NYMPH Mortal! You found me in evil company, high kickers, coster picnic makers, pugilists, popular generals, immoral panto boys in flesh tights and the nifty shimmy dancers, La Aurora and Karini, musical act, the hit of the century. I was hidden in cheap pink paper that smelt of rock oil. I was surrounded by the stale smut of clubmen, stories to disturb callow youth, ads for transparencies, truedup dice and bustpads, proprietary articles and why wear a truss with testimonial from ruptured gentleman. Useful hints to the married. BLOOM  We have met before. On another star. THE NYMPH  Rubber goods. Neverrip. Brand as sup plied to the aristocracy. Corsets for men. I cure fits or money refunded. Unsolicited testimonials for Professor Waldmann's wonderful chest exuber. My bust developed four inches in three weeks, reports Mrs Gus Rublin with photo. BLOOM You mean Photo Bits? THE NYMPH I do. You bore me away, framed me in oak and tinsel, set me above your marriage couch. Unseen, one summer eve, you kissed me in four places. And with loving pencil you shaded my eyes, my bosom and my shame. BLOOM  Your classic curves, beautiful immortal. I was glad to look on you, to praise you, a thing of beauty, almost to pray. THE NYMPH During dark nights I heard your praise. BLOOM  Yes, yes. You mean that I... Sleep reveals the worst side of everyone, children perhaps excepted. I know I fell out of my bed or rather was pushed. Steel wine is said to cure snoring. For the rest there is that English invention, pamphlet of which I received some days ago, incorrectly addressed. It claims to afford a noiseless inoffensive vent.  'Twas ever thus. Frailty, thy name is marriage. THE NYMPH  And words. They are not in my dictionary. BLOOM You understood them? THE YEWS Ssh. THE NYMPH  What have I not seen in that chamber? What must my eyes look down on? BLOOM  I know. Soiled personal linen, wrong side up with care. The quoits are loose. From Gibraltar by long sea, long ago. THE NYMPH  Worse! Worse! BLOOM  That antiquated commode. It wasn't her weight. She scaled just eleven stone nine. She put on nine pounds after weaning. It was a crack and want of glue. Eh? And that absurd orangekeyed utensil which has only one handle. THE WATERFALL Poulaphouca Poulaphouca Poulaphouca Poulaphouca. THE YEWS  Listen. Whisper. She is right, our sister. We grew by Poulaphouca waterfall. We gave shade on languorous summer days. JOHN WYSE NOLAN  Prosper! Give shade on languorous days, trees of Ireland! THE YEWS  Who came to Poulaphouca with the high school excursion? Who left his nutquesting classmates to seek our shade? BLOOM  I was in my teens, a growing boy. A little then sufficed, a jolting car, the mingling odours of the ladies' cloakroom and lavatory, the throng penned tight on the old Royal stairs, for they love crushes, instincts of the herd, and the dark sexsmelling theatre unbridles vice. Even a pricelist of their hosiery. And then the heat. There were sunspots that summer. End of school. And tipsycake. Halcyon days. THE HALCYON DAYS Mackerel! Live us again. Hurray! BLOOM  Again! I feel sixteen! What a lark! Let's ring all the bells in Montague Street.  Hurray for the High School! THE ECHO Fool! THE YEWS  She is right, our sister. Whisper.  Who profaned our silent shade? THE NYMPH  There! In the open air? THE YEWS  Sister, yes. And on our virgin sward. THE WATERFALL Poulaphouca Poulaphouca Phoucaphouca Phoucaphouca. THE NYMPH  O! Infamy! BLOOM I was precocious. Youth. The fauns. I sacrificed to the god of the forest. The flowers that bloom in the spring. It was pairing time. Capillary attraction is a natural phenomenon. Lotty Clarke, flaxenhaired, I saw at her night toilette through ill-closed curtains, with poor papa's operaglasses. The wanton ate grass wildly. She rolled downhill at Rialto Bridge to tempt me with her flow of animal spirits. She climbed their crooked tree and I... A saint couldn't resist it. The demon possessed me. Besides, who saw? STAGGERING BOB Me. Me see. BLOOM Simply satisfying a need.  No girl would when I went girling. Too ugly. They wouldn't play. THE NANNYGOAT  Megegaggegg! Nannannanny! BLOOM  Regularly engaged. Circumstances alter cases.  Thirtytwo head over heels per second. Press nightmare. Giddy Elijah. Fall from cliff. Sad end of government printer's clerk.  THE DUMMYMUMMY Bbbbblllllbbblblodschbg? COUNCILLOR NANNETI  When my country takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then let my epitaph be written. I have... BLOOM Done. Prff. THE NYMPH  We immortals, as you saw today, have not such a place and no hair there either. We are stonecold and pure. We eat electric light.  Spoke to me. Heard from behind. How then could you... ? BLOOM  O, I have been a perfect pig. Enemas too I have administered. One third of a pint of quassia, to which add a tablespoonful of rocksalt. Up the fundament. With Hamilton Long's syringe, the ladies' friend. THE NYMPH In my presence. The powderpuff.  And the rest. BLOOM  Yes. Peccavi! I have paid homage on that living altar where the back changes name.  For why should the dainty scented jewelled hand, the hand that rules... ? THE VOICE OF KITTY  Show us one of them cushions. THE VOICE OF FLORRY Here. THE VOICE OF LYNCH  Whew! Piping hot! THE VOICE OF ZOE  Came from a hot place. THE VOICE OF VIRAG  Hot! Hot! Ware Sitting Bull! BLOOM It overpowers me. The warm impress of her warm form. Even to sit where a woman has sat, especially with divaricated thighs, as though to grant the last favours, most especially with previously well uplifted white sateen coatpans. So womanly full.

(He hurries out through the hall. The whores point. Florry follows, spilling water from her tilted tumbler. On the doorstep all the whores clustered talk volubly, pointing to the right where the fog has cleared off From the left arrives a jingling hackney car. It slows to in front of the house. Bloom at the halldoor perceives Corny Kelleher who is about to dismount from the car with two silent lechers. He averts his face. Bella from within the hall uses on her whores. They blow ickylickysticky yumyum kisses. Corny Kelleher replies with a ghostly lewd smile. The silent lechers turn to pay the jarvey. Zoe and Kitty still point right. Bloom, parting them swiftly, draws his caliph's hood and poncho and hurries down the steps with sideways face. Incog Haroun al Baschid, he flits behind the silent lechers and hastens on by the railings with fleet step of a pard strewing the drag behind him, torn envelopes drenched in aniseed. The ashplant marks his stride. A pack of bloodhounds, led by Hornblower of Trinity brandishing a dogwhip in tallyho cap and an old pair of grey trousers, follows from far, picking up the scent, nearer, baying, panting, at fault, breaking away, throwing their tongues, biting his heels, leaping at his tail.

PRIVATE CARR  God fuck old Bennett! He's a whitearsed bugger. I don't give a shit for him. FIRST WATCH  What's his name? BLOOM  I just see a car there. If you give me a hand a second, sergeant. FIRST WATCH Name and address. BLOOM  O, the very man!  Simon Dedalus' son. A bit sprung. Get those policemen to move those loafers back. SECOND WATCH Night, Mr Kelleher.

Will I give him a lift home? Where does he hang out? Somewhere in Cabra, what? BLOOM No, in Sandycove, I believe, from what he let drop. CORNY KELLEHER  Sandycove!  Eh!  Eh! He's covered with shavings anyhow. Take care they didn't lift anything off him. BLOOM No, no, no. I have his money and his hat here and stick. CORNY KELLEHER Ah well, he'll get over it.

7b5ZmnRg42LXGAprG0q9hs,これは ゆでちゃんの物語だ オハヨーゆでちゃん みんなで遊びに来ましたよ 代のおばさん連中が ゆでちゃんの住むアパートに 早朝から 勝手に押し掛けて来たわけだ 動物のドキュメンタリービデオを 夜遅くまで見ていた ゆでちゃんからしたら たまったものではない こんなことならしっかりと 部屋の鍵を閉めておくべきだった ゆでちゃんは後悔した ゆでちゃんは目を開ける 大体が知らないばばあだ ゆでちゃんは逃避するように 頭から布団をかぶる も～ ゆでちゃん起きてよ みんなでせっかく来たんだからさ～ ゆでちゃんは沈黙を貫く ね～ みんな ゆでちゃん布団から出てこない気だから 無理矢理　布団を剥いじゃいましょ鵜よ せーの やめろ　やめろ　ふざけるな ゆでちゃん必死に布団を押さえた だが おばさん人の腕力には勝てなかった ほーら出て来た あら　ゆでちゃん ま～ 剥がされた布団から出て来たのは 白ブリーフ一枚のゆでちゃん歳 元詩人　現在無職 手にはどういう訳かヌガーの包み紙が 握られている ゆでちゃんは古い中華飯店で ラーメンをすすっていた ワカメとネギ シナチクとナルト 衛星軌道に乗った初めてのブリーフ 持ち主は当然ゆでちゃん なぜなら ゆでちゃんはアイアンメンのように 高速浮遊術が使えるのです 時間前、ゆでちゃんは 垂直に高度をあげて うち上がった それはもうロケットのごとく 高度が大気圏外まで達したとき 衛星軌道に向けてみずからの 白ブリーフを解き放ったのである 現在 ゆでちゃんのブリーフは 時速 kmで地球の周りを回っている すなわち ブリーフを脱ぎ捨てた ゆでちゃんは 全裸でラーメンをすすっていることになる 塩　醤油　バター　豚骨 お団子頭の女子 芸能人のサイン そんなものに興味は無い 味噌　ゆでちゃん　味噌 その一点につきる ゆでちゃんの目はいつになく真剣だった 珍しくゆでちゃんは合同コンパ 通称合コンというやつに参加している いつもはブリーフ一枚のゆでちゃんだけど 今回は若いレディーの前ということで ビシッと紺色のジャージ　上下で決めている 今回の会合の幹事であり ゆでちゃんの親友でも ある奥村は時計をチラチラと見て気にしている そうなのだ　肝心のレディー達が まだ到着していないのだ 他の男性参加者が奥村に口々に文句を言う中 ゆでちゃんは　腕を組み 目を閉じたまま沈黙を貫いている そんな　ゆでちゃんの 静けさの中のただならぬ殺気に 他の男達も気づき場に沈黙が流れる 実は ゆでちゃん　緊張しているのだ 普段から　ばばあ共にはモテモテのゆでちゃんだが 若いレディー達の前ともなると勝手が違う どう振る舞うべきかいろいろとシュミュレーション を頭の中で繰り返す ハニワ　密林　パンプキンケーキ 中央分離帯にリス匹　名古屋城付近 カポエラ使い　テリーメンの髪型 やがて時間遅れで女性陣が到着する これといって美人はいないが 不美人もいない ゆでちゃん達 中年にはもったいないくらい のレディーがやって来たのだ 奥村の乾杯の 挨拶を皮切りに 自己紹介タイムが行われた ゆでちゃんは知っていた この自己紹介タイムの第一印象で この会合における 自分の立ち位置がきまること すなわちこの自己紹介が成功すれば レディーとのベットインも 成功したようなものなのだ つぎつぎに自己紹介がなされ とうとうゆでちゃんの番がやってくる ゆでちゃんは静かに口を開く 袴田ユデ彦　歳　童貞 仕事は　現在無職であります 特技は　高速浮遊 趣味は・・・ ゆでちゃんはここで それまでつぶっていた目をカッと見開く 趣味は勉強でございます ゆでちゃんの趣味は勉強 どうやら　ゆでちゃんは 自分を高く見せようとしてしまったようだ 現代都市生活者につきまとう 病理　すなわちストレス ゆでちゃんはその発散方法の一つとして コンピュータゲームを選択していた 携帯型ゲーム機BS本体に カセットを挿入する ロード後　モニターに映し出されたのは 帽子ブラザーズのタイトル画面 つい先ほど中古ショップから 購入したばかりの 新作タイトルだ ゆでちゃんは最初からフルパワーで コントローラーのボタンに連射を打ち込む 当然　モニターの中の メタボリック帽子男は フルパワーで走り始める しかし向かいからは巨大栗の怪物 「くりぽー」が悠々と闊歩してくる 通常ならばジャンプをすることで この危機を乗り越えられるのだが ゆでちゃんは一歩も引かない そのまま一直線にダッシュ ここで逃げたら 俺はもう一生立ち直れなくなる 気づくとゆでちゃんも一緒に 街中を疾走していた ゲーム機を構え ブリーフ一枚 闇夜を駆ける メタボリック帽子男に くりぽーが迫るのと同じように 現実のゆでちゃんにもダンプカーが迫る ゆでちゃんはどうなる このあと　ゆでちゃんはどうなるというのか そのあと メタボリック帽子男とゆでちゃんは 共に蒲田シティーの路上に立っていた 奇跡が起きたのだ 意気投合した　ゆでちゃんとメタボリック帽子男は一晩中 公園で飲み明かしたと聞く 南国の孤島 ビーチにはバカンスを楽しむ 資本主義経済の勝者達 ゆでちゃんは そうした一団が戯れる 区画とは離れた場所で 一人作業に没頭していた ヶ月ぶりに手にした仕事 それがこの島に週間住み込みで 独り 芋を掘るという仕事だった 一日のノルマ分 掘った芋は倉庫の中に入れておく 朝になると倉庫の芋はどこかに 運ばれている その繰り返しを日ほど続けている 最初に作業説明に来ただけの 片言の現地スタッフはいたが 現場を監督する人もいない 本当に一人きりの作業 ただ芋を手作業で掘り起こしていく 意味などは無く ただ　金を稼ぐために 手を動かす 早く日本に帰りたい この仕事を終えたときに入ってくる 金があれば、ヶ月は働かなくても 暮らしていけるはずだ 土　芋　遠くに海と空 土　芋　遠くに海と空 土　芋　土　女 芋芋女芋 ゆでちゃんは次第に この掘り起こした芋が 若い女性に思えて来たのだ そう考えるとこの作業がとても楽しくなった 土を掘っていくと 女の子達が笑顔でゆでちゃんを迎えてくれる 沢山の女の子に囲まれるゆでちゃん 作業最終週 ゆでちゃんはミリナという 一人の芋の少女に恋心を抱いてしまった ミリナはあどけない顔に似合わない とてもグラマラスなボディーをしていた その夜、ゆでちゃんは倉庫でミリナと一緒に 体を重ねて　寝たのだった 朝目を覚ますと 大勢女の子達はどこかに運ばれていた 当然ミリナもすでにそこにはいなかった 放心状態のまま残りの作業期間を終えて 日本に帰宅した　ゆでちゃん 自宅に帰る途中近所の八百屋の店先を見て ゆでちゃんは戦慄した そこにはあのミリナが笑顔で立っていたのだ これは神が与えた奇跡なのか・・・ その数日後 芋を抱えた、タキシードのゆでちゃんが 白いチャペルから 楽しげに出て来たと聞きます 最近ネットで話題になっている新しいジャンルの 音楽だ サウンド的にはBPMの遅いダークなトラックの上に オリジナルの「呪文」がひたすら 詠唱され続けている 不気味なサウンドだ その音楽を最初にはじめたのは日本人の ハンバーガージョニーという 歳の大学生 ハンバーガージョニーのアルバムが ドイツのネットレーベルからリリースされ 徐々に話題となりヨーロッパ全体に広がりだした 最近日本にも逆輸入的に紹介され ネット音楽を好む層を中心に 話題になっている そしてハンバーガージョニーの主催する ネットレーベルSpellwave Tokyo からは常に刺激的な音源がリリースされている Spellwave Tokyoのリリースパーティーには毎回沢山の 若者が集まる。コスプレ美少女からギャルっぽい娘まで 綺麗どころが大勢遊びに来ている訳だ そんなSpellwaveシーンの状況を 嫉妬の眼差しで見ている男がいた ゆでちゃん歳だ ゆでちゃんはブリーフ一枚 暗い部屋でPCモニターを眺めている ゆでちゃんは年前ポエムコアという 新しいジャンルを作り出し 一時、めろめろ動画界隈では話題になった 勢いにのったゆでちゃんは ポエムコアライフというネットレーベルを立ち上げて イベントも開催したのだった しかしそれは話題になったような気がしていただけで 実際の結果は散々 レーベルのリリースは音源が集まらなくて 作品でストップ クラブを借りて意気込んで開催したイベントには お客さんが人しか入らなかったのだ Spellwaveとポエムコアはサウンド的にはよく似た感じだった そのことがゆでちゃんの嫉妬心をさらに肥大させた モニターに反射するゆでちゃんの歪んだ顔は ひどく滑稽だった ゆでちゃんは制作したポエムコア音源を Spellwave Tokyoに送ったこともあるが、方向性が 合わないという理由でリリース出来なかった 確かに　Spellwaveは圧倒的にスタイリッシュで ダンスミュージックとしての完成度も高かった ポエムコアは所詮、スカムなネタ程度のものという認識で 忘れ去られたのだ それでもゆでちゃんは現在までポエムコアを作り続けている 真っ白だったブリーフも大分黄ばんでいる ゆでちゃんはこの一曲に ポエムコア再生の全てをかけていた 全時間に及ぶ大作 「ひとで物語」だ 現在ミックス作業を残すのみという段階まできている しかしゆでちゃんは今夜行われる Spellwave Tokyoのイベントが気になっていた ポエムコアのイベントを開いたときに お客さんの中に一人だけ 女の子が来ていた 代前半ぐらいで　蒼い髪をしていて フロアの隅でポエムに合わせ 妖精の様に　ゆらゆらと体を揺らしていた イベント全体でお客さんが人とはいえ 自分のイベントに可愛い女性が来てくれたことが うれしくて たまらずに話しかけたのだ 昔から若い女性が苦手で 現在も男ばかりの工場に勤務する ゆでちゃんにとって その行為はとても珍しいことだった 「ゆでひこです　今日はイベントに遊びに来てくれてありがとうございます」 「ゆでひこさんの　ポエムコアいつもお家で聴いてます」 「ありがとうございます　何かお酒でも飲みますか」 ゆでちゃんは女の子にドリンクを奢ろうとしたのだ 「いえ お酒は大丈夫です・・・あたしバイクで来てるんで ミネラルウォーターなら・・・」 「ちょっと待っていてくださいね」 ゆでちゃんはカウンターでミネラルウォーターを注文し 彼女に手渡した 「ありがとうございます ゆでひこさん　その・・・本当にブリーフ一枚なんですね」 「あっ　ごめんなさいレディーの前でブリーフ一枚なんて 本来ありえないですよね　でもこれ僕のポリシーなんですよ あ、あの　ポエムコアのどんなところが好きなんですか？」 「ポエムコア・・・の好きなところ ごめんなさい あたし　ゆでひこさん以外のポエムコア あんまり聴いてなくて ゆでひこさんの作品の 好きなところなら答えられますけど・・・」 「聞かせててください」 「ださいところかな　ださいけど暖かいところが好きです」 ゆでちゃんはそのときとても舞い上がった しかし　現在その蒼い髪の女性は Spellwave Tokyoのイベントの常連で 露出度の高いアニメキャラの コスプレをしていると風の噂で聞いた Spellwave Tokyoのイベントがやはり気になる ゆでちゃんの嫉妬心は 音楽の化け物を生み出す燃料だ 息抜きもこめてイベントに行ってみるか・・・ コスプレ美少女も拝見できることだし・・・ ギャルブランドのパーカーをブリーフの上に羽織る これは、とある カリスマギャルモデルのトークショーで行われた じゃんけん大会で 代のギャルを尻目に 歳のゆでちゃんが勝ち進み ゲットした一張羅だ 黒い一輪車にまたがる　ゆでちゃん 蒲田シティーから、渋谷までこいつで 闇の中をこぎ出す たぶん、ゆでちゃんが渋谷に着く頃には Spellwave Tokyoのイベントは とっくに終了しているだろう 完全な無駄足だと彼を笑うのは簡単だ しかし 全ての答えは出ていない いずれ正しさの基準なんてものは覆される 全てのゆでちゃんは そのまま　闇を突き進んでかまわない ゆでちゃんは 一人ではない あなたも　ゆでちゃんであるように

6JJnqVcOBfIaKXDjZqxOUv,これは ゆでちゃんの物語だ オハヨーゆでちゃん みんなで遊びに来ましたよ 代のおばさん連中が ゆでちゃんの住むアパートに 早朝から 勝手に押し掛けて来たわけだ 動物のドキュメンタリービデオを 夜遅くまで見ていた ゆでちゃんからしたら たまったものではない こんなことならしっかりと 部屋の鍵を閉めておくべきだった ゆでちゃんは後悔した ゆでちゃんは目を開ける 大体が知らないばばあだ ゆでちゃんは逃避するように 頭から布団をかぶる も～ ゆでちゃん起きてよ みんなでせっかく来たんだからさ～ ゆでちゃんは沈黙を貫く ね～ みんな ゆでちゃん布団から出てこない気だから 無理矢理　布団を剥いじゃいましょ鵜よ せーの やめろ　やめろ　ふざけるな ゆでちゃん必死に布団を押さえた だが おばさん人の腕力には勝てなかった ほーら出て来た あら　ゆでちゃん ま～ 剥がされた布団から出て来たのは 白ブリーフ一枚のゆでちゃん歳 元詩人　現在無職 手にはどういう訳かヌガーの包み紙が 握られている ゆでちゃんは古い中華飯店で ラーメンをすすっていた ワカメとネギ シナチクとナルト 衛星軌道に乗った初めてのブリーフ 持ち主は当然ゆでちゃん なぜなら ゆでちゃんはアイアンメンのように 高速浮遊術が使えるのです 時間前、ゆでちゃんは 垂直に高度をあげて うち上がった それはもうロケットのごとく 高度が大気圏外まで達したとき 衛星軌道に向けてみずからの 白ブリーフを解き放ったのである 現在 ゆでちゃんのブリーフは 時速 kmで地球の周りを回っている すなわち ブリーフを脱ぎ捨てた ゆでちゃんは 全裸でラーメンをすすっていることになる 塩　醤油　バター　豚骨 お団子頭の女子 芸能人のサイン そんなものに興味は無い 味噌　ゆでちゃん　味噌 その一点につきる ゆでちゃんの目はいつになく真剣だった 珍しくゆでちゃんは合同コンパ 通称合コンというやつに参加している いつもはブリーフ一枚のゆでちゃんだけど 今回は若いレディーの前ということで ビシッと紺色のジャージ　上下で決めている 今回の会合の幹事であり ゆでちゃんの親友でも ある奥村は時計をチラチラと見て気にしている そうなのだ　肝心のレディー達が まだ到着していないのだ 他の男性参加者が奥村に口々に文句を言う中 ゆでちゃんは　腕を組み 目を閉じたまま沈黙を貫いている そんな　ゆでちゃんの 静けさの中のただならぬ殺気に 他の男達も気づき場に沈黙が流れる 実は ゆでちゃん　緊張しているのだ 普段から　ばばあ共にはモテモテのゆでちゃんだが 若いレディー達の前ともなると勝手が違う どう振る舞うべきかいろいろとシュミュレーション を頭の中で繰り返す ハニワ　密林　パンプキンケーキ 中央分離帯にリス匹　名古屋城付近 カポエラ使い　テリーメンの髪型 やがて時間遅れで女性陣が到着する これといって美人はいないが 不美人もいない ゆでちゃん達 中年にはもったいないくらい のレディーがやって来たのだ 奥村の乾杯の 挨拶を皮切りに 自己紹介タイムが行われた ゆでちゃんは知っていた この自己紹介タイムの第一印象で この会合における 自分の立ち位置がきまること すなわちこの自己紹介が成功すれば レディーとのベットインも 成功したようなものなのだ つぎつぎに自己紹介がなされ とうとうゆでちゃんの番がやってくる ゆでちゃんは静かに口を開く 袴田ユデ彦　歳　童貞 仕事は　現在無職であります 特技は　高速浮遊 趣味は・・・ ゆでちゃんはここで それまでつぶっていた目をカッと見開く 趣味は勉強でございます ゆでちゃんの趣味は勉強 どうやら　ゆでちゃんは 自分を高く見せようとしてしまったようだ 現代都市生活者につきまとう 病理　すなわちストレス ゆでちゃんはその発散方法の一つとして コンピュータゲームを選択していた 携帯型ゲーム機BS本体に カセットを挿入する ロード後　モニターに映し出されたのは 帽子ブラザーズのタイトル画面 つい先ほど中古ショップから 購入したばかりの 新作タイトルだ ゆでちゃんは最初からフルパワーで コントローラーのボタンに連射を打ち込む 当然　モニターの中の メタボリック帽子男は フルパワーで走り始める しかし向かいからは巨大栗の怪物 「くりぽー」が悠々と闊歩してくる 通常ならばジャンプをすることで この危機を乗り越えられるのだが ゆでちゃんは一歩も引かない そのまま一直線にダッシュ ここで逃げたら 俺はもう一生立ち直れなくなる 気づくとゆでちゃんも一緒に 街中を疾走していた ゲーム機を構え ブリーフ一枚 闇夜を駆ける メタボリック帽子男に くりぽーが迫るのと同じように 現実のゆでちゃんにもダンプカーが迫る ゆでちゃんはどうなる このあと　ゆでちゃんはどうなるというのか そのあと メタボリック帽子男とゆでちゃんは 共に蒲田シティーの路上に立っていた 奇跡が起きたのだ 意気投合した　ゆでちゃんとメタボリック帽子男は一晩中 公園で飲み明かしたと聞く 南国の孤島 ビーチにはバカンスを楽しむ 資本主義経済の勝者達 ゆでちゃんは そうした一団が戯れる 区画とは離れた場所で 一人作業に没頭していた ヶ月ぶりに手にした仕事 それがこの島に週間住み込みで 独り 芋を掘るという仕事だった 一日のノルマ分 掘った芋は倉庫の中に入れておく 朝になると倉庫の芋はどこかに 運ばれている その繰り返しを日ほど続けている 最初に作業説明に来ただけの 片言の現地スタッフはいたが 現場を監督する人もいない 本当に一人きりの作業 ただ芋を手作業で掘り起こしていく 意味などは無く ただ　金を稼ぐために 手を動かす 早く日本に帰りたい この仕事を終えたときに入ってくる 金があれば、ヶ月は働かなくても 暮らしていけるはずだ 土　芋　遠くに海と空 土　芋　遠くに海と空 土　芋　土　女 芋芋女芋 ゆでちゃんは次第に この掘り起こした芋が 若い女性に思えて来たのだ そう考えるとこの作業がとても楽しくなった 土を掘っていくと 女の子達が笑顔でゆでちゃんを迎えてくれる 沢山の女の子に囲まれるゆでちゃん 作業最終週 ゆでちゃんはミリナという 一人の芋の少女に恋心を抱いてしまった ミリナはあどけない顔に似合わない とてもグラマラスなボディーをしていた その夜、ゆでちゃんは倉庫でミリナと一緒に 体を重ねて　寝たのだった 朝目を覚ますと 大勢女の子達はどこかに運ばれていた 当然ミリナもすでにそこにはいなかった 放心状態のまま残りの作業期間を終えて 日本に帰宅した　ゆでちゃん 自宅に帰る途中近所の八百屋の店先を見て ゆでちゃんは戦慄した そこにはあのミリナが笑顔で立っていたのだ これは神が与えた奇跡なのか・・・ その数日後 芋を抱えた、タキシードのゆでちゃんが 白いチャペルから 楽しげに出て来たと聞きます 最近ネットで話題になっている新しいジャンルの 音楽だ サウンド的にはBPMの遅いダークなトラックの上に オリジナルの「呪文」がひたすら 詠唱され続けている 不気味なサウンドだ その音楽を最初にはじめたのは日本人の ハンバーガージョニーという 歳の大学生 ハンバーガージョニーのアルバムが ドイツのネットレーベルからリリースされ 徐々に話題となりヨーロッパ全体に広がりだした 最近日本にも逆輸入的に紹介され ネット音楽を好む層を中心に 話題になっている そしてハンバーガージョニーの主催する ネットレーベルSpellwave Tokyo からは常に刺激的な音源がリリースされている Spellwave Tokyoのリリースパーティーには毎回沢山の 若者が集まる。コスプレ美少女からギャルっぽい娘まで 綺麗どころが大勢遊びに来ている訳だ そんなSpellwaveシーンの状況を 嫉妬の眼差しで見ている男がいた ゆでちゃん歳だ ゆでちゃんはブリーフ一枚 暗い部屋でPCモニターを眺めている ゆでちゃんは年前ポエムコアという 新しいジャンルを作り出し 一時、めろめろ動画界隈では話題になった 勢いにのったゆでちゃんは ポエムコアライフというネットレーベルを立ち上げて イベントも開催したのだった しかしそれは話題になったような気がしていただけで 実際の結果は散々 レーベルのリリースは音源が集まらなくて 作品でストップ クラブを借りて意気込んで開催したイベントには お客さんが人しか入らなかったのだ Spellwaveとポエムコアはサウンド的にはよく似た感じだった そのことがゆでちゃんの嫉妬心をさらに肥大させた モニターに反射するゆでちゃんの歪んだ顔は ひどく滑稽だった ゆでちゃんは制作したポエムコア音源を Spellwave Tokyoに送ったこともあるが、方向性が 合わないという理由でリリース出来なかった 確かに　Spellwaveは圧倒的にスタイリッシュで ダンスミュージックとしての完成度も高かった ポエムコアは所詮、スカムなネタ程度のものという認識で 忘れ去られたのだ それでもゆでちゃんは現在までポエムコアを作り続けている 真っ白だったブリーフも大分黄ばんでいる ゆでちゃんはこの一曲に ポエムコア再生の全てをかけていた 全時間に及ぶ大作 「ひとで物語」だ 現在ミックス作業を残すのみという段階まできている しかしゆでちゃんは今夜行われる Spellwave Tokyoのイベントが気になっていた ポエムコアのイベントを開いたときに お客さんの中に一人だけ 女の子が来ていた 代前半ぐらいで　蒼い髪をしていて フロアの隅でポエムに合わせ 妖精の様に　ゆらゆらと体を揺らしていた イベント全体でお客さんが人とはいえ 自分のイベントに可愛い女性が来てくれたことが うれしくて たまらずに話しかけたのだ 昔から若い女性が苦手で 現在も男ばかりの工場に勤務する ゆでちゃんにとって その行為はとても珍しいことだった 「ゆでひこです　今日はイベントに遊びに来てくれてありがとうございます」 「ゆでひこさんの　ポエムコアいつもお家で聴いてます」 「ありがとうございます　何かお酒でも飲みますか」 ゆでちゃんは女の子にドリンクを奢ろうとしたのだ 「いえ お酒は大丈夫です・・・あたしバイクで来てるんで ミネラルウォーターなら・・・」 「ちょっと待っていてくださいね」 ゆでちゃんはカウンターでミネラルウォーターを注文し 彼女に手渡した 「ありがとうございます ゆでひこさん　その・・・本当にブリーフ一枚なんですね」 「あっ　ごめんなさいレディーの前でブリーフ一枚なんて 本来ありえないですよね　でもこれ僕のポリシーなんですよ あ、あの　ポエムコアのどんなところが好きなんですか？」 「ポエムコア・・・の好きなところ ごめんなさい あたし　ゆでひこさん以外のポエムコア あんまり聴いてなくて ゆでひこさんの作品の 好きなところなら答えられますけど・・・」 「聞かせててください」 「ださいところかな　ださいけど暖かいところが好きです」 ゆでちゃんはそのときとても舞い上がった しかし　現在その蒼い髪の女性は Spellwave Tokyoのイベントの常連で 露出度の高いアニメキャラの コスプレをしていると風の噂で聞いた Spellwave Tokyoのイベントがやはり気になる ゆでちゃんの嫉妬心は 音楽の化け物を生み出す燃料だ 息抜きもこめてイベントに行ってみるか・・・ コスプレ美少女も拝見できることだし・・・ ギャルブランドのパーカーをブリーフの上に羽織る これは、とある カリスマギャルモデルのトークショーで行われた じゃんけん大会で 代のギャルを尻目に 歳のゆでちゃんが勝ち進み ゲットした一張羅だ 黒い一輪車にまたがる　ゆでちゃん 蒲田シティーから、渋谷までこいつで 闇の中をこぎ出す たぶん、ゆでちゃんが渋谷に着く頃には Spellwave Tokyoのイベントは とっくに終了しているだろう 完全な無駄足だと彼を笑うのは簡単だ しかし 全ての答えは出ていない いずれ正しさの基準なんてものは覆される 全てのゆでちゃんは そのまま　闇を突き進んでかまわない ゆでちゃんは 一人ではない あなたも　ゆでちゃんであるように
